2
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:45,920
<i>Everything changes.</i>

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,922
<i>That's just a fact.</i>

4
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,635
<i>They say a mammoth never forgets.</i>

5
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,961
<i>Well, as I get older,</i>

6
00:00:54,051 --> 00:00:56,598
<i>I find they don't always
remember either.</i>

7
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,951
<i>I've decided to put it all down here,</i>

8
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,520
<i>so it'll never change.
Our herd history.</i>

9
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,195
<i>It all started with Manny,</i>

10
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:07,525
<i>my lovable grouch of a mammoth.</i>

11
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,278
<i>He'd lost his family to hunters.</i>

12
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>Heartbreak made him a loner.</i>

13
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>And then there was Sid,
a big-hearted sloth…</i>

14
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,578
<i>…had been abandoned by his family</i>

15
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:23,166
<i>because he could be, let's just say,
a little annoying.</i>

16
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,006
<i>And Diego, a fierce saber-tooth.</i>

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,009
<i>He risked his life
to defy his ruthless pack</i>

18
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,053
<i>and was left with nowhere to go.</i>

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:38,515
<i>Fate brought this unlikely trio together</i>

20
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,726
<i>when they were charged
with the care of a lost baby.</i>

21
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,163
<i>And in returning the child
to its family,</i>

22
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>they became a family themselves.</i>

23
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,110
<i>Now, Manny thought
he was the last mammoth in the Ice Age</i>

24
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>and was convinced he'd never find love.</i>

25
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>That is, until he met me, Ellie.</i>

26
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,784
<i>We felt the earth move.</i>

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,995
<i>Nineteen tons of combined weight
will do that.</i>

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,928
<i>I joined the herd along with
my adopted possum brothers,</i>

29
00:02:05,026 --> 00:02:06,626
<i>Crash and Eddie.</i>

30
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,922
<i>The six of us had
so many adventures.</i>

31
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,051
<i>But every time
we thought it was the end of the world,</i>

32
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,512
<i>it only brought us closer together.</i>

33
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,307
<i>Even when we stumbled into
a Lost World of dinosaurs</i>

34
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,643
<i>living under the ice.</i>

35
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,605
<i>We met a fearless weasel
named Buck.</i>

36
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>He was daring,
adventurous and a little eccentric.</i>

37
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,112
<i>Crash and Eddie
wanted to be just like him.</i>

38
00:02:34,572 --> 00:02:36,448
<i>Now that we've found each other,</i>

39
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:39,909
<i>I want to preserve
every moment we have together,</i>

40
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>because you never know
when things will change.</i>

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,834
<i>And lately, it seems like my brothers
are getting a little restless.</i>

42
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,297
I can't wait to show this to the boys.

43
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,383
Crash! Eddie!

44
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,427
Whoo-hoo!

45
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,141
This is gonna be
our most extreme stunt ever.

46
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,357
Extremely dangerous.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,983
Super-duper dangerous.

48
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,818
Stupendously dangerous.

49
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:25,789
Whoa.

50
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,749
That's a long way down.

51
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,876
Only if we make it to the bottom.

52
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,712
Crash! Eddie!

53
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,548
You better not be
doing something dangerous!

54
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,468
You know, I've been thinking...

55
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,428
What? When did you start doing that?

56
00:03:40,512 --> 00:03:41,513
Last week.

57
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,682
And you didn't say anything?

58
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,850
Why'd you do it, Crash? Why?

59
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,353
We're supposed to be brothers.

60
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,479
I couldn't help it.

61
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,940
I was just sitting there,
and I thought,

62
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,235
"Aren't you tired of Ellie
always telling us what we can't do?"

63
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,528
Yeah.

64
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,906
"Don't use tar pits as a bubble bath."
"Don't gargle with fire ants."

65
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,118
"Don't scale the side of an unstable,
10,000 foot glacier."

66
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:09,040
She's smothering us
with reasonable advice.

67
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,877
What if we move out
and get our own place?

68
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,213
Ooh! You mean a bachelor den?

69
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:18,466
Nah, I was thinking more of a place
where two single guys hang out.

70
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,176
Oh, that's way better.

71
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,429
Just imagine it.

72
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,514

73

80
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,031
Boys!

81
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,033
Don't make me come get you.

82
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:49,706
Look. I think it's time
we become independent possums.

83
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:01,509
I claim this mountain
in the name of possum freedom!

84
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,820
Crash!

85
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,614
Eddie!

86
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,032
Where are those two?

87
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,786
So that's why I've always thought
that good hygiene is overrated,

88
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,082
but what really makes me feel special
is that you guys listen to me.

89
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,585
You really listen. And the…

90
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,224
Uh-huh. I'll do it later, dear.
I promise.

91
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,643
Manny! We gotta go!

92
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,858
Ice-alanche!

93
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,277
All right!

94
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,238
Whee-hee-hee-hee!

95
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,198
Whoa!

96
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,373
Yeah!

97
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:16,876
- Yay!
- Whoo-hoo!

98
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,931
It took us all spring
to build that summer habitat!

99
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,057
All spring!

100
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,268
And you destroyed it in seconds!

101
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,686
Whoo! That's a new record.

102
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:37,647
It took us, like, eight minutes
to destroy our fall habitat.

103
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:40,817
But why'd you build it
right in the middle of our ice-alanche?

104
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,193
Rookie error, dude.

105
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,031
Diego! They're all yours.

106
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,200
About time.

107
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:55,832
Oh, great. Now I have rabies.

108
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,960
Okay, okay.
Let's work this out like a family.

109
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,340
Manny, use your feeling words. "I feel…"

110
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,925
Come on. "I feel…"

111
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,388
I feel like I'm about to crush you
like a grape.

112
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,515
That's good. Breakthrough!

113
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,893
Okay, look, it was an accident.

114
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,978
Let's just try to find
a new place to sleep

115
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:19,147
and you can yell at 'em
in the morning.

116
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,815
I might as well yell at rocks.

117
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,346
If it wasn't for her protection,

118
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,271
you two would've been gone long ago.

119
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:26,221
Ha! If it wasn't for her,

120
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,199
we'd be out there in
the world a-roaming.

121
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,534
Yeah! Our a-roaming skills are strong.

122
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,878
No, your aroma is strong.

123
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:35,600
You'd never survive on your own.

124
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,249
- We could if we wanted.
- Yeah... Oh, yeah?

125
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,336
- I double-dog dare you to prove it.
- Manny, stop egging them on.

126
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,006
Well, I'm just saying, maybe they've
reached a point in their lives

127
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,300
where they're ready
to get out of my hair.

128
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:53,348
I... I mean, you know,
go find their own destiny. Huh?

129
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,767
- Nobody's going anywhere!
- Why not?

130
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,354
Because you can't
do anything for yourselves.

131
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,732
Anything you can do,
we can do nearly almost as well.

132
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,776
Can you clean your own habitat?

133
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,070
Can you feed yourselves?

134
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,364
Can you protect yourself
from predators?

135
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,200
Oh, sure, bring those things up.

136
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:14,124
We do things that matter.

137
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:15,537
Like this.

138
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,838
The offense rests.

139
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:28,925
You know, even though you're my brothers,
sometimes I wish

140
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:32,846
you were a little more mammoth
and a little less possum.

141
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,852
She just insulted our possum-ness.

142
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:42,272
Which is a very big part of who we are.

143
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,734
That does it!
I'm done being treated like a baby.

144
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,446
It's time for us to move out
and make our mark on the world!

145
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,740
I make my mark on
the world every day.

146
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,285
I just lift my leg and do it.
That tree is mine, for instance.

147
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,203
And that tree, and that one.

148
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:00,874
And that rock over there.
And your pillow too!

149
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,220
Go sleep over there.

150
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,931
And turn on your side
so you don't keep me up snoring all night.

151
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,350
I... I don't snore.

152
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:21,394
Trust me,
you blow that face tuba all night long.

153
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:26,274
Yeah, oh... Okay, look, I'm sorry
about what I said to Crash and Eddie.

154
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,527
It's just...
Well, family can be difficult.

155
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:33,865
We are a nutty, mixed-up herd
full of loners and outcasts.

156
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,493
And that's just on my side.

157
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,788
Right, and you don't hear me
complain about your side ever.

158
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:41,915
My side takes care of themselves.

159
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,834
Yeah, well, Diego does.

160
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,338
And then we both take care of Sid.

161
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,342
Nah, don't you gotta...
You've gotta save some for later though.

162
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,095
Well, possum families
just aren't like that.

163
00:09:55,178 --> 00:10:00,642
Yeah, you know, you could let them
face consequences sometimes. Just saying.

164
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,896
How? By kicking them out?
You know they can't survive on their own.

165
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,606
Mmm. Interesting.

166
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,776
Well, maybe what scares you
is that they won't need you anymore.

167
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:14,114
Or maybe it's the fact that their
only natural defense is to play dead.

168
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,324
They're my brothers.

169
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,077
They're the only family
I had before you.

170
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,204
They saved my life, Manny.

171
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,357
<i>Mama Possum raised me
as one of her own.</i>

172
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,818
<i>I was never happier.</i>

173
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,720
<i>I finally felt like I was home.</i>

174
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,272
Aw…

175
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,697
<i>And when we lost her,
I was heartbroken.</i>

176
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:41,868
<i>But I knew my brothers and I
would always have each other.</i>

177
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:48,333
Well, Sis, I guess
you're the head possum of the family now.

178
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,144
You know, I lost my mama too.

179
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,981
Well, technically, she moved away
without leaving a forwarding address.

180
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,441
But then I found Manny here.

181
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,152
And then, when Diego came along
and tried to kill us,

182
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,279
we knew we were destined to be a family.

183
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,241
Sid, don't you have somewhere else
to sleep?

184
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:22,701
Don't you?

185
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,264
We can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

186
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,939
Goodbye, Sis.
It's time for us to make our own destiny.

187
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,317
And maybe even make our own lunch.

188
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,569
We may never see you again.

189
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,104
Huh?

190
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,941
Did you hear that?

191
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:21,945
Huh? Wha... I... I don't hear anything.

192
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,949
Right. It's too quiet.
Nothing's breaking. No one's fighting.

193
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,826
That can only mean one thing.

194
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,829
They're gone.
They took all their things.

195
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,455
They don't have any things.

196
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,540
Exactly.

197
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:36,251
Uh-oh.
This is not gonna go well for you.

198
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:40,755
Manny, my brothers are out there
in the wild, and it's all your fault.

199
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,840
What, my fault?

200
00:14:41,923 --> 00:14:45,427
Well, you did challenge them
to try to survive on their own.

201
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,595
In effect,
sending them to their doom.

202
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,763
Thanks, Sid.

203
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,391
Anytime, buddy.
I always got your back.

204
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:52,600
Don't worry, honey.

205
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:56,521
If... If Crash and Eddie get into trouble,
they'll find their way back.

206
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,814
Find their way back?

207
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,066
The only thing worse
than their survival skills

208
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:01,526
is their sense of direction.

209
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,737
Mmm. And their math skills
aren't great either.

210
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,405
Come on. We've got to find them.

211
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,661
They also have
zero musical talent.

212
00:15:11,781 --> 00:15:13,830
And they're awful at bird calls.

213
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,714
Dude, being on our own totally rules!

214
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,967
And we've got nothing to worry about
since we've got nine lives.

215
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:29,054
- Oh, come on. Everyone knows that's dogs.
- Oh.

216
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:30,764
Well, how many lives do we get?

217
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,682
I forget.
It's either four or eleven.

218
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:39,272
Destiny awaits!

219
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,570
Destiny hurts.

220
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,495
Have we been here before?

221
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,164
It does look kinda familiar.

222
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,125
Wait. Is this the way
to the Lost World?

223
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:02,462
It's the most exciting place
we've ever been!

224
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,341
It's also the most dangerous.
Do you think we can find it?

225
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:09,010
With our keen sense of direction?

226
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,639
Puh-lease. To the Lost World!

227
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,059
Dead end!

228
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,269
To the Lost World!

229
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,455
It's hopeless.
We'll never find it.

230
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,499
Found it!

231
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,171
Ooh.

232
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:49,092
Ellie told us never,
ever to go back in there.

233
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,602
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

234
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,773
- To the Lost World!
- To the Lost World!

235
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:12,115
Whoa!

236
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,412
I smell mammals.

237
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,842
Snack time.

238
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,562
Your breath, dude.
You've gotta brush more.

239
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,359
I think I just swallowed
my Adam's apple.

240
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,616
One of us should give ourselves up
so the other can get away!

241
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,743
Good idea! I volunteer you!

242
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:06,628
That was close.

243
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:10,548
Crash,
it's just like I remembered it!

244
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,766
It always amazes me
there's a whole world down here.

245
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,142
Right below our feet.

246
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,645
And a giant spider
right above our heads.

247
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:39,703
We're gonna be goners!

248
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:43,206
Yeah! And then
we'll only have three or ten more lives!

249
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,751
You know that whole
"living on our own" thing?

250
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:49,212
- Yeah?
- I'm starting to question our judgment!

251
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,756
Well, this is the perfect time to do it.

252
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,101
I remember this guy.
He's allergic to possums.

253
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,739
Hello, boys!

254
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:17,282
- Buck!
- Buck?

255
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,994
That's right!
Buck Wild, at your service.

256
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,412
Our hero!

257
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,831
The legend of the Lost World!

258
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,458
The wizard of weasels!

259
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,043
The yin to my yang!

260
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,920
Your ways are strange
and mysterious, Buck,

261
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:32,213
but mostly strange.

262
00:19:32,297 --> 00:19:33,506
Thanks for dropping in.

263
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,468
Will the rest of the herd
be falling from the sky too?

264
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,179
I don't think I can catch the mammoths.
One, maybe.

265
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,433
Mayday! Mayday!
We're coming in hot!

266
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:48,021
Whoa!

267
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,941
This is your captain speaking.

268
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,987
Please keep your whiskers and bottoms
inside the dactyl at all times.

269
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,614
Whoo-hoo!

270
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,121
- Buck!
- Crack!

271
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:18,009
You picked a bad time
for a tropical vacation, lads.

272
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:21,096
A dino named Orson
just escaped from exile.

273
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,224
And he's jonesing to rule
the Lost World.

274
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,017
Now he's got a couple of raptors.

275
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,479
And if he succeeds,
no mammal will be safe.

276
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,065
Whoa! Well, it's a good thing
I'm not a mammal.

277
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,900
- You are a mammal.
- Sorry, bro.

278
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,985
Looks like life dealt you a bad hand.

279
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,153
You're a mammal too.

280
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:38,321
That's impossible.

281
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,949
What are the odds of two possums
being mammals?

282
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:44,911
Well, they're the same odds
that you'll both be a raptor's brunch

283
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:46,788
if I don't get you out of here.

284
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,214
Got to feed Penelope.

285
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,927
She needs gas,
and these berries will give it to her.

286
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,305
Back off, Brenda.
They're friends of mine.

287
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,433
Brenda.

288
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:08,893
Spit.

289
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,063
Spit.

290
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,235
So far, best day ever!

291
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,155
Now, tell me, what brings you two
to my world?

292
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:21,322
We moved out.

293
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:23,700
Yeah, we're mature now.

294
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,076
Really?

295
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,829
Well, at first, Ellie was all…
"Yada yada yada."

296
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,373
And then Manny was like…
"Blah, blah, blah."

297
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,459
Yeah, that does sound like him.

298
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,961
And Diego was all...

299
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,421
I mean, you know how he is.

300
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,590
And then Ellie said, "I don't like it,

301
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:41,217
but I suppose it's time.
Good luck out there."

302
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,804
Then she hugged us, Sid scratched himself,
and bingo bongo in the Congo, we're here!

303
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,891
You're telling me Ellie
gave her okey dokey

304
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,226
to this little artichokey
of a mission here?

305
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,811
Oh, yeah. Totally.

306
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,104
Hmm?

307
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,273
Okay, okay. We snuck out.

308
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:56,649
Ow!

309
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:58,234
You try to survive that look.

310
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:05,075
I admit it! Whatever it is!

311
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:07,369
I've got to take you back home, fellas.

312
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,454
I'm the only one that can stop Orson,

313
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:12,707
but I won't be able to do that
if I have you two to look after.

314
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,125
But-but-but-but, Buck,

315
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,796
we came here to live a life
of adventure, like you.

316
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,548
You boys are nature's least likely
to survive.

317
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:23,259
And this is its most dangerous place.

318
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,762
Wow. Talk about a perfect match.

319
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,523
I'll be back in a minute, girl.

320
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,275
Buck, don't send us back.

321
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We wanna hang here with you.

322
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,446
Please. We're independent.

323
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,781
Both of us.

324
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:45,907
Together.

325
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:49,828
This boulder's not supposed to be here.
How did it get here?

326
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,705
Hmm… How do you think?

327
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:52,956
Well, how should I know?

328
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,335
Unbelievable.
Your cluelessness is truly breathtaking.

329
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,171
Don't you take that tone
with me, Rocky.

330
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,632
Now I insist you roll away at once.

331
00:23:02,716 --> 00:23:05,635
Uh, I don't think
it's the boulder talking.

332
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,513
Well, not anymore.
I obviously intimidated him.

333
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:11,933
Seems like Mr. Boulder here
is all growl and no gravel.

334
00:23:12,017 --> 00:23:14,561
Wow. Okay, enough.

335
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,146
I can't do this anymore.

336
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,149
Hey, I'm over here,
you soon-to-be ex-weasel.

337
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,569
Look at me.
Look at me with your dumb little eye.

338
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,655
Orson.

339
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,324
Buck.

340
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,534
Eddie.

341
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:31,995
Crash.

342
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,789
I heard you'd returned. But how?

343
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,334
Nobody escapes from Lava Island.

344
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,545
Well, not everyone
has my colossal intellect.

345
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:44,341
Which is dwarfed only by your ego
and insecurity.

346
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,343
Why'd you seal the exit, Orson?

347
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:49,888
Oh, no reason. Just to keep
filthy animals like you

348
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:55,101
from coming in and infecting our ecosystem
with your fur and warm blood.

349
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:57,520
Lost World for lost species!

350
00:23:57,604 --> 00:24:00,190
Dinos rule… …mammals drool.

351
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,233
It's true. You do.

352
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,153
Wait a minute. Dinos don't talk.

353
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:07,614
They just grunt and
roar like nincompoops.

354
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,450
That's good. Hey, that's funny.
That's really funny.

355
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,327
Dinos have tiny brains.

356
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,496
Like I haven't heard that a million times.

357
00:24:14,579 --> 00:24:17,332
Does this brain look tiny to you?

358
00:24:17,415 --> 00:24:19,626
Holy moly, that's huge!

359
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,795
Seriously. That thing's a planet.

360
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:24,881
I'm surprised there isn't
a little moon going around it.

361
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,468
That kind of reaction used to hurt.
I thought I was a freak.

362
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:33,807
Then I realized that my massive brain
made me the smartest creature alive!

363
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,560
But you know the best part?
The joke's on you.

364
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:40,397
My brain, the thing
that everyone ridiculed,

365
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,274
is the one thing
that's gonna get me my revenge.

366
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,277
I'll rule everyone under the ice!

367
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,573
Not even you can stop me this time,
Buckmeinster.

368
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,619
It's Buckminster.

369
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:58,540
Though most call me Buck.

370
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:00,834
"Buckmeinster" is not even a name.

371
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,754
That's like me calling you "Shmorson."

372
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:09,676
Whatever, Bucky. Now that I've got
some muscle behind me,

373
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:12,429
it's a whole new ball game.

374
00:25:13,555 --> 00:25:15,432
There's gonna be a ball game?

375
00:25:15,515 --> 00:25:18,351
Check it out.

376
00:25:22,981 --> 00:25:25,775
Well, look. They've gone and died.

377
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,028
No one wants to eat dead possums.

378
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:30,655
It's too chewy.
It's like eating hairy gum.

379
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:31,740
Okay.

380
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,408
I can totally see you're breathing.

381
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:36,786
Look, look... Right there.
Look, even these morons can see it.

382
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,124
Time for a possum picnic!

383
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,418
Oh!

384
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:48,548
Oh!

385
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:53,345
Until our next tango,
<i>mi iguana gigante</i>.

386
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,565
No one outsmarts Orson!

387
00:26:06,274 --> 00:26:08,902
Now, we're gonna have to play
a little game called

388
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,029
"drop goes the weasel."

389
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,157
It means, take down Buck!

390
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:17,494
Oh, my... Geez.

391
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:20,038
What did I say about boundaries, huh?

392
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,999
And you! Stop copying me!

393
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:36,012
It's not safe here, girl.
Better take off for the night.

394
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:39,432
Be careful.

395
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:45,105
Where to next, Buck?

396
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,107
We're already here.

397
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,592
Buck's bachelor den!

398
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,637
Wow.

399
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:21,016
Talk about a possum paradise.

400
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:24,436
Hang on.
Gotta pay the cucumber for babysitting.

401
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:29,357
Crash, wouldn't it be awesome
if we could live here with Buck?

402
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,067
Look, I know I said
it was gonna be three hours,

403
00:27:31,151 --> 00:27:32,235
but it was only two, and...

404
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,113
I'm not gonna pay for an hour
where you didn't do anything.

405
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,699
- He's got everything.
- I'll pay you for three.

406
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,868
You drive a hard bargain
for a salad pincher.

407
00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,704
Right, I just hope you didn't spend
the whole time talking to your boyfriend.

408
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:46,666
You remember my daughter?

409
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,126
Bronwyn!

410
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:52,964
She's gotten so big and round, and big.

411
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:54,549
These are your uncle possums.

412
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:57,802
She doesn't remember you
because she was so young.

413
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,304
And also 'cause she's a squash.

414
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:03,808
Buck, I know you like living alone here
with your farm-fresh daughter,

415
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:06,770
but wouldn't it be nice
to have a couple of roommates?

416
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,313
Free pumpkin care.

417
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,106
And we charge less than cucumbers.

418
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:13,777
Sorry, boys. I'm a solo operator
who can't be tied down.

419
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,321
You can stay until I've stopped Orson,
but after that,

420
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,074
I'm gonna find a way
to get you back home.

421
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,701
Well, maybe we could help you
stop Orson.

422
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,536
Dude, up top!

423
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:36,800
Crash!

424
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:37,926
Eddie!

425
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:42,514
I don't mean to be a negative Nancy,
but they've been gone a while.

426
00:28:42,597 --> 00:28:45,600
Shouldn't we just be
looking for bones at this point?

427
00:28:47,018 --> 00:28:49,646
I respectfully withdraw the question.

428
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:51,272
Hey, Über-tracker,

429
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:52,941
you picked up that scent yet?

430
00:28:53,024 --> 00:28:56,861
Aside from you,
nothing smells bad. So, no.

431
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:02,200
Manny, they're out there all alone
in the cold. They're probably frightened.

432
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,994
Look, don't worry.
We'll find them.

433
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:08,248
Because if we don't find them,
I'm gonna kill them.

434
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:12,627
It's a figure of speech. And ow!

435
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,968
Ha, ha, ha!

436
00:29:20,051 --> 00:29:22,637
You've got nowhere to run, Orson!

437
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:26,307
Or should I say Shmorson.

438
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:37,027
So, how are you gonna defeat
this Shmorson dude anyway?

439
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,862
That is a good question, Crash.

440
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,281
- I'm Eddie, the handsome one.
- Right.

441
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,575
Back in the day,
Orson was tough on his own.

442
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,493
But now he's got some trained raptors,

443
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,580
taking him down
is gonna be a little bit trickier.

444
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:50,248
Why is he such a meanie anyway?

445
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,708
Another good question, Eddie.

446
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,585
I'm Crash, the other handsome one.

447
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:58,048
When he was young, Orson was teased
and got all insecure about his big head.

448
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,425
The bigger his head grew,
so too did his brain.

449
00:30:00,508 --> 00:30:03,428
And he realized
that this was his greatest strength.

450
00:30:03,511 --> 00:30:07,349
But he came to believe
he was superior to everyone else.

451
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,309
I tried to show him we were all equals.

452
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,354
I even invited him to be part of
this team I belonged to.

453
00:30:14,689 --> 00:30:16,691
<i>We established the watering hole
as a place</i>

454
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:20,195
<i>where all species
could learn to peacefully coexist.</i>

455
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,656
<i>My team was dedicated to protecting it</i>

456
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,785
<i>and making sure all animals down here
lived in harmony.</i>

457
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,954
Whoa!

458
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,207
Like a superhero squad?

459
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,543
Well, I wouldn't use the term "superhero."

460
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:38,588
I mean, I wouldn't stop you
from using it. Anyway.

461
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:41,549
<i>Orson turned down my offer.</i>

462
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:45,804
<i>He didn't believe in harmony.</i>

463
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:49,182
<i>He believed in a world
where the strong dominate the weak.</i>

464
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,727
Hello! Can you repeat that?

465
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:54,688
I had a marshmallow in my ear.

466
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:56,898
I said…

467
00:30:56,981 --> 00:30:58,566
<i>Orson believed in a world…</i>

468
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:02,737
<i>…where the strong dominate the weak,
and that he should dominate all.</i>

469
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:09,494
<i>And since I stood in his way,
he set a trap to get rid of me.</i>

470
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,301
<i>We defeated Orson that day.</i>

471
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:28,471
But at great cost.

472
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,729
To keep the Lost World safe,
we banished Orson

473
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,731
to a place called Lava Island.

474
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,608
<i>And not the nice one.</i>

475
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,154
<i>We thought a little alone time
would help Orson</i>

476
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,697
<i>to have a change of heart,</i>

477
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,866
<i>but his heart hardened even more</i>

478
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:49,159
<i>and he became obsessed</i>

479
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:50,702
<i>with getting revenge.</i>

480
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,871
<i>We didn't know he'd have company.</i>

481
00:31:56,916 --> 00:31:58,376
<i>We're not sure how he survived</i>

482
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,337
<i>or what happened next.</i>

483
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,308
Ooh.

484
00:32:15,518 --> 00:32:18,480
Ooh. You likey the fire?

485
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:22,734
<i>All we know is that Orson
somehow escaped from Lava Island</i>

486
00:32:22,817 --> 00:32:25,236
<i>with a couple of raptors
under his command.</i>

487
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:31,242
Sit.

488
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,037
Stand.

489
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:39,084
Bow to me.

490
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:48,259
Ah, simpletons. All it takes
is a little fire to bend you to my will.

491
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:52,138
The Lost World will finally be mine.

492
00:32:54,265 --> 00:32:56,393
<i>And he was free.</i>

493
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:58,395
Ooh.

494
00:32:58,478 --> 00:32:59,604
And then what happened?

495
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,650
Then you two showed up
and nearly got yourselves killed.

496
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,735
Yay, we're in the story!

497
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:13,368
Okay, boys. Lights out.

498
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,664
Buck, can you tell us more
about the superhero team?

499
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,918
Uh, nah.
That's a tale for another night.

500
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:25,171
Whoa, whoa!

501
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,339
Shh!

502
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,342
Shh!

503
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,549
Oh, for crying out loud!

504
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:05,730
What's that smell?

505
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,650
Oh, yeah. Gas.

506
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:09,776
Yours?

507
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,737
Zee.

508
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,539
Buck.

509
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,332
Buck?

510
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:25,583
Buck?

511
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,377
Buck?

512
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,256
The possums! The possums!

513
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,341
Gas don't faze us, dude.

514
00:35:33,425 --> 00:35:34,968
We're used to things that stink.

515
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,473
Looking for this?

516
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:51,526
Wow.

517
00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:53,862
Zee, is that you?

518
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:56,489
Well, someone had to save your butt.

519
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:01,828
So I picked me.

520
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,663
Wait. What about Bronwyn?

521
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,999
She's safe.
I left her with the cucumber.

522
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:08,710
Good. The cucumber knows karate.

523
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:12,922
Dude. Psst. You know Bronwyn's, like,
a pumpkin, right?

524
00:36:13,006 --> 00:36:16,051
Yeah. I also know Buck's got a cousin
who's a pine cone.

525
00:36:16,134 --> 00:36:17,552
Oh, right. Philip.

526
00:36:17,635 --> 00:36:20,263
Buck, who's your awesome skunk friend?

527
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:23,391
I'm not a skunk, guys. I'm a zorilla.

528
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,934
What's the difference?

529
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:28,563
The difference is
I'm a mammal on a mission

530
00:36:29,064 --> 00:36:32,025
to bring equality
and justice to the Lost World.

531
00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:35,278
Also, skunks have slightly shorter tails.

532
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:36,780
She's totally a skunk.

533
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,491
A skunk with a secret identity!

534
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:41,201
Cool.

535
00:36:41,284 --> 00:36:43,745
Well... I... Okay, yeah.

536
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,873
If that'll get you going, great.

537
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,958
Come on,
those boneheads are waking up.

538
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:50,502
We'll follow you anywhere.

539
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,380
Off a cliff, underwater,
into a volcano.

540
00:36:56,424 --> 00:36:57,884
I like your new friends.

541
00:36:59,678 --> 00:37:01,096
They make me feel smart.

542
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:02,931
Don't worry.
What they lack in intelligence,

543
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:05,433
they make up for in bumbling ineptitude.

544
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:09,145
Buck, we have some unfinished business
to take care of.

545
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:13,400
I mean, you know. Look. I know
we didn't always see eye to eye.

546
00:37:13,483 --> 00:37:15,944
Or, in my case, eyes to eye.

547
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:21,199
Relax. I'm only here for one reason,
and it's bigger than you and me.

548
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:27,163
If we don't stop Orson, he'll destroy
the harmony we fought so hard for.

549
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:30,875
With him in charge,
the Lost World will be, well…

550
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,461
lost.

551
00:37:33,545 --> 00:37:34,921
Oh.

552
00:37:35,505 --> 00:37:36,631
Right.

553
00:37:37,465 --> 00:37:40,135
And because then it will be
the "Lost Lost World,"

554
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:42,345
which is both sad and confusing.

555
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:45,056
Is the team getting back
together again?

556
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,474
You stay out of it, you!

557
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:48,226
I thought you two stopped talking.

558
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:49,936
We patched things up.

559
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,981
And no, Lefty.
The team's not getting back together.

560
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,859
Once we stop Orson,
I'm outta here.

561
00:37:55,942 --> 00:37:57,610
That's a secret skunk for ya.

562
00:37:57,694 --> 00:37:59,821
They never stay in one place too long.

563
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:02,032
Of course that glorious scent lingers.

564
00:38:13,043 --> 00:38:16,755
Hmm. No, no, no. My head's not that big.
This is not to scale at all.

565
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,258
- I know you're there.
- I know you're there.

566
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,719
What have I said about copying, huh?

567
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:26,014
Uh-uh-uh. Don't... Don't...
Don't you... Don't you dare.

568
00:38:26,514 --> 00:38:29,100
Stop copying me!

569
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,772
Oh, I should have worked with birds.

570
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,148
Huh?

571
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:39,778
Huh.

572
00:38:39,861 --> 00:38:42,697
Clearly you two aren't nearly enough
to get the job done.

573
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,534
Time to add to my posse.

574
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:48,203
What I'm about to do next

575
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:51,706
will destroy everything you've worked for,
Buckmeinster.

576
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:55,710
Get out of my face!

577
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,214
How'd you know those raptors
were gonna attack?

578
00:38:59,297 --> 00:39:01,716
Unfortunately,
Orson's been tracking you.

579
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,052
Fortunately, I've been tracking Orson.

580
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:08,640
Then, I guess it's up to you guys
to stop 'em.

581
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:11,101
Two superheroes joining forces again!

582
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,770
Buck Wild and Skunk-a-tor!

583
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:16,314
I can't believe you told them
we were superheroes.

584
00:39:16,398 --> 00:39:19,359
I would never say that.
They said it.

585
00:39:19,442 --> 00:39:21,611
Well, you two must have been a great team!

586
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:24,656
Only when we agreed on things,
which was never.

587
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,116
I agree with that.

588
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,492
What's the problem, Buck?

589
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:30,453
She's pretty cool
with that super spray of hers.

590
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:32,414
Hey, what's your superpower anyway?

591
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,543
Boys, what makes a superhero isn't powers.

592
00:39:39,212 --> 00:39:41,464
It's resourcefulness and courage.

593
00:39:41,965 --> 00:39:44,592
Yeah, that's what they always say
when they don't have any powers.

594
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,012
Anyways, back to the plan.

595
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:50,598
We have a control freak egomaniac
to catch up to.

596
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:53,518
Yeah. And we've also gotta stop Orson.

597
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:02,610
This is my worst-case scenario.
They're heading for the watering hole!

598
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:16,875
Blimey. Orson's gonna serve his raptors
an all-you-can-eat mammal buffet.

599
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,547
Okay, here's the plan.

600
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,841
No time for a plan!

601
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:28,094
There is always time for a pla...

602
00:40:28,178 --> 00:40:31,056
Okay, he can't hear me anymore.

603
00:40:37,187 --> 00:40:38,396
Whoa!

604
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,317
Hey.

605
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,364
Everyone, we face a grave threat!

606
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:49,908
Are we out of fruity drinks again?

607
00:40:49,991 --> 00:40:53,078
We've gotta clear the area.
File out in an orderly fashion.

608
00:40:53,161 --> 00:40:56,831
Two by two, one by three, five by nine.

609
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:08,051
Nope, still can't fly.

610
00:41:14,933 --> 00:41:16,101
No!

611
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:19,604
Go, go, go!

612
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:30,657
It's time to get buck wild!

613
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,200
Ow!

614
00:41:34,994 --> 00:41:36,246
What'd you do that for?

615
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:37,872
Look!

616
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:49,509
Buck! Oh, boy,
do I have a surprise for you.

617
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:51,469
Behold!

618
00:41:58,226 --> 00:42:00,937
He's done it.
He's built an army.

619
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,857
I'm gonna RSVP "no" to this party.

620
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:05,734
We need to get out of here.

621
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:24,002
I'm coming for you, Bucky!

622
00:42:24,085 --> 00:42:26,921
And you won't weasel your way out
the next time.

623
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:29,966
You can't protect
the mammals forever, Buck.

624
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,720
My new raptor army
will eventually hunt you down.

625
00:42:34,304 --> 00:42:36,431
Now we really need a plan.

626
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:42,562
We'll never defeat Orson if you keep going
all "buck wild" without thinking first.

627
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:46,649
The more important question
is what does "Zee" stand for?

628
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,236
Aw. You're cute.
Let's stay on track, shall we?

629
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,864
We are completely outmatched.

630
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:56,868
If we're gonna defeat Orson,
we're gonna need some big-time help.

631
00:42:56,951 --> 00:43:01,831
Hmm. Would you look at that?
I agree with Zee. We do need help.

632
00:43:01,915 --> 00:43:05,085
And there's only one creature
who can handle the job.

633
00:43:08,254 --> 00:43:13,009
Did you hear what he said? He said we!
He sees us as equals.

634
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,179
Actually, I think he meant…

635
00:43:18,473 --> 00:43:20,642
total equals. You got it.

636
00:43:20,725 --> 00:43:23,353
Oh, and, uh, by the way, fellas,
the name thing?

637
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,230
It's just Zee.

638
00:43:25,313 --> 00:43:27,857
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

639
00:43:34,656 --> 00:43:36,783
My bone boat.

640
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:39,494
Whoa! Buck's bone boat.

641
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:41,371
I believe it's our bone boat.

642
00:43:41,454 --> 00:43:44,582
Whoa! Buck and Zee's bone boat.

643
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:47,252
- I built it.
- I designed it.

644
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:48,795
It didn't need a design.

645
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:53,550
That's why the first boat sank.

646
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:57,262
It didn't sink. The water rose.

647
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,139
Do you sense some tension
between them?

648
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:00,223
Maybe a little.

649
00:44:18,533 --> 00:44:20,994
We'll reach Lost Lagoon by morning.

650
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:23,621
You know what I'm wondering?

651
00:44:23,705 --> 00:44:26,791
Why we're going to Lost Lagoon
and who's gonna help us defeat Orson?

652
00:44:26,875 --> 00:44:29,544
No. I'm wondering
why my butt's stuck to the seat.

653
00:44:29,627 --> 00:44:30,628
Tree sap.

654
00:44:30,712 --> 00:44:32,172
You know what else I'm wondering?

655
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:34,507
How could they have been
such a fierce team,

656
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,009
but still not get along?

657
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:38,928
I bet it's 'cause Zee never told him
what the "Zee" stood for.

658
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:41,973
Okay, out with it. Is it Zeeva?

659
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:43,558
- Zelda?
- Zeena?

660
00:44:43,641 --> 00:44:45,602
- Zsa Zsa?
- Zamantha.

661
00:44:45,685 --> 00:44:46,728
Zippy?

662
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:49,397
I'm sorry.
Did you just say Zippy?

663
00:44:49,481 --> 00:44:51,149
I told you it wasn't Zippy.

664
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:54,235
Uh, once again,
Zee doesn't stand for anything.

665
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,029
And that's not the reason.

666
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:57,906
So what is the reason?

667
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:02,285
- It's because he... Never mind.
- It's because she... Never mind.

668
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:04,537
Let's work this out like family.

669
00:45:04,621 --> 00:45:07,248
Yeah, use your feeling words.

670
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:08,625
I feel…

671
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:10,543
I feel.

672
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:15,131
Well, I feel Buck was stubborn
and reckless.

673
00:45:15,215 --> 00:45:18,385
Well, I feel Zee gets too hung up
on details.

674
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:21,137
I also feel sad about my first boat.

675
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:24,099
This is good.
I think we're getting somewhere.

676
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:26,351
You're irresponsible, thickheaded.

677
00:45:26,434 --> 00:45:28,478
- You're demanding, and you're always…
- I'm tired of you…

678
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:30,647
- …being mean to me.
- …always leaping before you look.

679
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:33,483
- Recklessly hurling us into trouble.
- …but the rest of the team didn't.

680
00:45:33,566 --> 00:45:35,068
We needed to have a strategy.

681
00:45:35,151 --> 00:45:36,653
Your way didn't work!

682
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:38,279
We lost our team.

683
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,661
I know, Zee. But maybe there was nothing
we could do to save them.

684
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:48,164
Maybe not, but you were my best friend.

685
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,458
And I lost you too.

686
00:45:52,669 --> 00:45:54,421
Zee.

687
00:45:58,341 --> 00:46:00,218
I feel that could've gone better.

688
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,996
Crash, I'm starting to think.

689
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,081
Oh, no. Now you're doing it too.

690
00:46:30,623 --> 00:46:32,083
When we left the herd,

691
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:35,503
we swore we'd become independent
and make our mark.

692
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:38,048
Yeah, but how?

693
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:41,134
Buck needs some shut-eye
and we're nocturnal.

694
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:45,055
This is our chance to prove ourselves.
Follow my lead.

695
00:46:46,431 --> 00:46:47,515
Hmm.

696
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:54,272
Okay, Lost Lagoon is due south.

697
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,940
We have to turn this boat around.

698
00:46:56,024 --> 00:46:57,901
You're holding the map upside down.

699
00:46:57,984 --> 00:46:59,402
Oh, well, in that case, we're good!

700
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,529
We're doing it! High five!

701
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:07,118
Oh. When is tea ready, Mum?

702
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:28,098
- Buck?
- Buck?

703
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:29,391
Buck?

704
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:31,893
Buck? Buck? Buck, Buck, Buck,

705
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:34,270
Buck, Buck, Buck,
Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck, Buck,

706
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:35,480
Buck!

707
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:36,690
Did I drift off?

708
00:47:37,273 --> 00:47:39,526
It's all good, Buck.
We kept the boat on track

709
00:47:39,609 --> 00:47:42,278
and made you a delicious a-breakfast.

710
00:47:42,362 --> 00:47:45,156
You got these from the trees?

711
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,366
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

712
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:50,495
That's very nice,
but they're also very poisonous.

713
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:53,415
From now on, keep your paws
and tails inside the boat.

714
00:47:53,498 --> 00:47:54,958
You don't know what's out there.

715
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,961
Oh, so maybe we shouldn't have
snagged these jump ropes.

716
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,796
Uh.

717
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:02,924
Guys, those are more poisonous
than the berries.

718
00:48:03,008 --> 00:48:04,551
We're immune to snake venom.

719
00:48:04,634 --> 00:48:07,303
Yeah, but I'm not. It would kill me.

720
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,598
It would make me break out
and then kill me.

721
00:48:10,682 --> 00:48:11,725
Our bad.

722
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,893
Sorry, Zsa Zsa.

723
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:18,523
Should we not have
adopted these cute pet lizards either?

724
00:48:23,153 --> 00:48:24,779
Maybe we're not ready to prove ourselves.

725
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:26,906
Ha! Speak for yourself.

726
00:48:31,286 --> 00:48:32,996
Okay, you can speak for both of us.

727
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:51,514
We've made it!
Time to summon an old friend.

728
00:49:08,823 --> 00:49:11,159
Crash, it's Mama T. rex!

729
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:13,411
Wait, you know Mama T?

730
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:16,206
Uh-huh. Our friend Sid
used to babysit her kids.

731
00:49:16,289 --> 00:49:18,667
She's gonna help us take out Orson.

732
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:23,546
Well, that totally makes sense.
She's 15 tons of deadly, vicious terror!

733
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,174
No offense, Mama.

734
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:30,804
What's wrong, girl?

735
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:36,017
Toothache, huh? Come on.
Let Dr. Buck take a look.

736
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:44,275
Left upper incisor impacted.
Lower right molar missing.

737
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:46,778
Ah! There's the bad tooth.

738
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:49,322
Yeah, I've got to 86 the 23.

739
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:53,326
That's what happens, young lady,
when you don't floss.

740
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,203
Which is why we use our tails.

741
00:49:55,787 --> 00:49:58,915
Well, how can she help us defeat Orson
with a bad tooth?

742
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,375
That is a good question.

743
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:03,712
I'm gonna need to pull it. Oi!

744
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:10,635
Well, if you're not going to let me help,
I guess I'll have to just give up.

745
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,777
Whoa! Respect.

746
00:50:33,241 --> 00:50:34,492
Hurry.

747
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:36,453
I'm performing surgery here.

748
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:40,123
If I let go, she'll surgically remove
your top from your bottom.

749
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:41,583
Boy, it's really in there.

750
00:50:43,918 --> 00:50:46,379
Okay, Zee.
All done. Time to wake her up.

751
00:50:46,463 --> 00:50:49,215
I just knock 'em out.
I don't wake 'em up.

752
00:50:51,843 --> 00:50:53,511
Incoming! We've got raptors!

753
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:55,764
Come on, boys!
Let's get her up.

754
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:57,515
We need to call in reinforcements.

755
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,476
She is the reinforcements!

756
00:51:00,226 --> 00:51:01,936
Hello? Anyone home?

757
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:04,064
You can sleep when you're dead!

758
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,273
Why'd you knock her out?

759
00:51:05,357 --> 00:51:06,441
You told me to.

760
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:07,901
- No, I didn't.
- You winked.

761
00:51:07,984 --> 00:51:10,653
I only have one eye.
Technically, that's a blink.

762
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:15,241
- Nap time's over.
- What did you have, bricks for lunch?

763
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:18,661
Well, here goes nothing.

764
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,373
Heads up, buttercup.

765
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:23,833
Go, go, go!

766
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,014
Oh, you're pathetic, Buck.

767
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,975
Did you really think reuniting with Zee

768
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:45,021
and recruiting some T. rex
could help you defeat my army?

769
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,210
Well, that was the idea. Yes.

770
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:10,755
Evidently, I miscalculated,
but nobody's perfect.

771
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:15,677
Except me, that is. I'm a genius
who's about to rule the Lost World.

772
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,679
Over our dead bodies!

773
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:22,809
My plan exactly. Soon everyone
will bow to me and call me king.

774
00:52:23,518 --> 00:52:24,936
Excuse me. Mm-hmm.

775
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:27,480
I'm trying to do my evil here!

776
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:29,566
I'm on a bit of a roll.

777
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:32,444
But enough of this discourse.

778
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:35,155
Let the feeding frenzy begin!

779
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:49,586
Buck!

780
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,768
Get away! Get away! Down!

781
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:08,355
Spray 'em, Zee!

782
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:11,858
I just sprayed!
I need time to refill, okay?

783
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:13,985
Ooh! TMI, dude.

784
00:53:52,023 --> 00:53:54,776
Actually, Zee, it was all my fault.

785
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:58,154
You're right.
We lost the team because of me.

786
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,990
No, it was because of me.

787
00:54:01,074 --> 00:54:03,743
No, I insist I take the blame.

788
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:06,955
Well, I insist you return the blame
and give it to me.

789
00:54:07,038 --> 00:54:10,583
Look, it wasn't you.
It wasn't me.

790
00:54:12,168 --> 00:54:13,586
- It was us.
- It was us.

791
00:54:14,087 --> 00:54:17,048
If we really want harmony
in the Lost World,

792
00:54:17,132 --> 00:54:19,843
it has to start with you and me
working together.

793
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:31,771
Get Mama and the possums to safety.

794
00:54:39,654 --> 00:54:40,989
Wha... What's he doing?

795
00:54:41,072 --> 00:54:42,574
Giving us time to escape.

796
00:54:43,616 --> 00:54:45,660
Okay, brainiac.

797
00:54:46,161 --> 00:54:47,370
It's me you want.

798
00:54:47,871 --> 00:54:49,748
You got me.

799
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:53,335
I win!

800
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,464
Take him to the watering hole.

801
00:54:57,547 --> 00:55:01,509
There, I'll make an example of him
in front of all the other mammals.

802
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:03,720
Whoa.

803
00:55:03,803 --> 00:55:05,555
Revenge is mine.

804
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:08,850
Hey, great idea alert.

805
00:55:09,351 --> 00:55:12,228
Guess who had it?
Me. Of course.

806
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:26,785
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy now.

807
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:29,245
Just get your strength back, Mama T.

808
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:33,124
Orson's taking Buck back
to the watering hole. Meet us there.

809
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:56,750
This is all our fault, Eddie.

810
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,919
Buck said it was
a bad time for us to visit.

811
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:02,380
Yeah, if he didn't have to
look out for us,

812
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:04,174
maybe this never would have happened.

813
00:57:04,257 --> 00:57:06,217
I wish we could've done something
to help him.

814
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:08,261
- Like what?
- I don't know.

815
00:57:08,803 --> 00:57:12,057
Something cool,
like master the power of lightning.

816
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,976
Whoa! How awesome would that be?

817
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:17,854
Crash and Eddie: Lightning Masters!

818
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:22,317
Yeah, we'd be all zap this and zap that.
And zap the first thing again.

819
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,736
Ah, face it, bro.

820
00:57:24,819 --> 00:57:28,198
We're never gonna be lightning masters,
or make our mark.

821
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:30,075
Or pretty much do anything.

822
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,494
Ellie was right about us.

823
00:57:32,577 --> 00:57:34,621
We're not ready to be on our own.

824
00:57:36,998 --> 00:57:40,085
Is this what Buck would do?
Give up? Sulk?

825
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:41,920
But we let him down.

826
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:45,131
Which means it's time
to buck up.

827
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,300
You mean rush in without thinking?

828
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,595
Yeah, well, he would do that.

829
00:57:50,679 --> 00:57:54,265
I, however, wouldn't have left
without a plan to rescue him.

830
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,601
But I'm gonna need your help.

831
00:57:56,685 --> 00:57:58,645
We could if we had a superpower.

832
00:57:59,896 --> 00:58:01,690
Remember what Buck taught you.

833
00:58:01,773 --> 00:58:04,275
It's not powers that make you
a superhero.

834
00:58:05,276 --> 00:58:07,153
It's courage.

835
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,863
And resourcefulness.

836
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:12,701
Maybe that's our problem, Crash.

837
00:58:12,784 --> 00:58:15,870
Whenever we're in trouble,
all we do is play dead.

838
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:17,622
Well, it is our go-to move.

839
00:58:17,706 --> 00:58:20,500
Yeah, but it's kinda
the opposite of courage.

840
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,544
Yeah, I see that.

841
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:25,213
But where can we get courage?

842
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:26,798
You already have it…

843
00:58:27,799 --> 00:58:28,883
right here.

844
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,969
In our chest fur?

845
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:33,930
She means our spleens.

846
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,181
Yeah!

847
00:58:35,265 --> 00:58:39,728
If we can harness the power
of our spleens, we can master lightning!

848
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:46,735
We're here on Raptor River.

849
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:49,904
Orson's got Buck
here at the watering hole.

850
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,781
We'll launch a surprise attack.

851
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:54,659
Like a surprise party with weapons.

852
00:58:55,452 --> 00:58:58,913
Mmm… I dunno, Zee,
or whatever your real name is.

853
00:58:58,997 --> 00:59:02,334
The three of us
against Orson's whole army?

854
00:59:02,417 --> 00:59:03,418
Hey!

855
00:59:03,501 --> 00:59:05,712
You would be surprised
what we're capable of.

856
00:59:06,379 --> 00:59:09,049
I just wish we knew
how Orson controls the raptors.

857
00:59:09,132 --> 00:59:12,802
Maybe he gives them treats.
I know I'd do anything for a marshmallow.

858
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,262
Would you marry a frog?

859
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:16,306
- What kind of frog?
- Focus, guys.

860
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:18,141
It's time to train for the mission.

861
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:39,120
Ha, ha, ha!

862
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:46,711
Whoa.

863
00:59:53,885 --> 00:59:57,138
Oh. Right in the possum parts.

864
01:00:20,328 --> 01:00:21,746
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha!

865
01:00:39,264 --> 01:00:42,308
Face it, guys.
Crash and Eddie have gone bye-bye.

866
01:00:42,392 --> 01:00:45,061
They totally disappeared
without a trace!

867
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:47,522
I got footprints.

868
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:51,568
All that means is their feet
were around here.

869
01:00:52,944 --> 01:00:55,155
Thank goodness.
We're back on their trail.

870
01:00:55,238 --> 01:00:57,407
It looks like their trail leads to a...

871
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:02,078
Oh, no! Those ding-dongs
went back to the Lost World!

872
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:04,998
Oh. And I thought I made bad choices.

873
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:27,687
We're in luck!
Orson's raptors got smaller.

874
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,147
Ha! They're tiny.

875
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:33,109
I say we crush them like ants,
then shoot hoops at the watering hole.

876
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,904
Guys, they're not tiny.
They're just far away.

877
01:01:36,696 --> 01:01:39,908
Oh. Well, in that case,
we're in huge trouble.

878
01:01:44,371 --> 01:01:45,413
Remember.

879
01:01:51,795 --> 01:01:53,129
It's time to get…

880
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:55,423
Buck wild!

881
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:02,681
The entrance is blocked.
Do you think they got through?

882
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,724
Only one way to find out.

883
01:02:14,609 --> 01:02:16,695
Come on.

884
01:02:27,664 --> 01:02:32,460
Whew! Those upper body workouts
really paid off.

885
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:34,546
Come on!
We need to find Buck.

886
01:02:34,629 --> 01:02:36,381
He's their only hope down here.

887
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:37,882
Oh, great.

888
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:41,678
Their lives may depend on
an unstable weasel who talks to his hand.

889
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:52,397
Sid!

890
01:02:55,316 --> 01:02:56,484
Run!

891
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:04,034
Whoa!

892
01:03:04,117 --> 01:03:05,577
- Ha!
- Oh!

893
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:09,789
Ow…

894
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,250
Huh?

895
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:20,175
Mama!

896
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:23,553
What's that, you say?

897
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,639
The watering hole?

898
01:03:28,808 --> 01:03:31,853
Oh, no!
Crash and Eddie are in trouble.

899
01:03:31,936 --> 01:03:34,022
You say that like it's news.

900
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:44,282
This is farewell, Buck.

901
01:03:44,366 --> 01:03:48,828
Time to turn you into a chew toy
for my ravenous friends here.

902
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:51,331
You'll never get away with this.

903
01:03:51,414 --> 01:03:53,708
There's no way I'm letting
my pumpkin daughter

904
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:55,126
grow up without a father.

905
01:03:55,710 --> 01:03:57,253
What? Okay, I'm done.

906
01:03:57,337 --> 01:04:02,133
Dinner is served,
compliments of King Orson.

907
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,677
Ooh, I like the sound of that.

908
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:19,067
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yeah!

909
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:21,361
Huh?

910
01:04:21,444 --> 01:04:23,363
Ooh! Morons!

911
01:04:23,446 --> 01:04:25,615
Good work, fellas!

912
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,075
Get skunked!

913
01:04:27,158 --> 01:04:28,326
Yeah!

914
01:04:29,202 --> 01:04:30,328
Hi-yah!

915
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,589
I love the smell of skunky gas
in the morning.

916
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,633
Whoo!

917
01:04:50,056 --> 01:04:52,851
Bye-bye, Bucky.

918
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:04,696
Yeah!

919
01:05:10,201 --> 01:05:14,706
Hang on, Crash and Eddie.
Here comes the T. rex express!

920
01:05:20,295 --> 01:05:21,588
Buck!

921
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:23,423
Hey-ya!

922
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:36,436
Whoo!

923
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:39,981
Whoa!

924
01:05:43,651 --> 01:05:46,279
You took a big chance
giving yourself up back there.

925
01:05:46,363 --> 01:05:48,573
That's what you do in a herd.

926
01:05:48,656 --> 01:05:52,285
Besides, I knew you'd be the one
to come and rescue me.

927
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:57,290
So, what now?
I'm sure you have something in mind.

928
01:05:57,374 --> 01:05:59,542
How about we make it up
as we go along?

929
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:01,961
Now, that's what I call a plan.

930
01:06:08,843 --> 01:06:11,388
- Whee-hee-hee-hoo!
- Oh, yeah!

931
01:06:14,808 --> 01:06:17,227
Whoa!

932
01:06:19,646 --> 01:06:22,774
Okay, I'm confused. What just happened?

933
01:06:22,857 --> 01:06:26,027
I believe Crash and Eddie
just kicked some serious butt.

934
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:35,787
- Yeah!
- All right, Mama!

935
01:06:36,287 --> 01:06:37,622
Wait for me, guys!

936
01:06:48,633 --> 01:06:49,676
Yes!

937
01:07:00,395 --> 01:07:03,606
You've been nothing but
a thorn in my side from the start.

938
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:06,234
You just never got it, Orson.

939
01:07:06,317 --> 01:07:09,154
The Lost World
isn't meant to be ruled by anyone.

940
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:12,532
Not just anyone. Me!

941
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:14,743
<i>En garde!</i>

942
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:26,087
All right, who wants some?

943
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:27,505
Take this!

944
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,091
And that! Huh?

945
01:07:30,884 --> 01:07:34,054
Time to get a little less mammoth
and a little more possum.

946
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:40,352
All right!

947
01:07:42,937 --> 01:07:44,814
Back off. He's family.

948
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:47,150
Besides, he's high in saturated fats.

949
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:50,653
Look, the truth is we all need each other.

950
01:07:54,741 --> 01:07:57,827
Down here, all creatures,
mammals and dinos alike,

951
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:00,080
we need to live in harmony.

952
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,999
Oh, you are so naive.

953
01:08:03,083 --> 01:08:05,335
This is why I feel sorry for you, Buck.

954
01:08:05,418 --> 01:08:06,920
You're too idealistic.

955
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:11,299
In the real world, it's survival
of the fittest, or should I say smartest.

956
01:08:21,601 --> 01:08:23,603
Oh! Nailed it.

957
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,277
Oh, no.

958
01:08:36,616 --> 01:08:37,659
Sic 'em.

959
01:08:37,742 --> 01:08:38,743
Alley-oop!

960
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,163
Stay! Down, boy.

961
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:44,541
Bad dinos. No bite! No bite!

962
01:08:44,624 --> 01:08:46,084
Ha, <i>croissant!</i>

963
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,088
<i>Baguette!</i>

964
01:08:50,171 --> 01:08:51,464
<i>Fromage!</i>

965
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,717
Looks like you got me, Bucky.

966
01:08:54,551 --> 01:08:57,012
Or do you?

967
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:59,639
Seems I've outsmarted you once again.

968
01:08:59,723 --> 01:09:02,517
They're gonna tear
your little friends to pieces,

969
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,311
and then they're gonna come for you.

970
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,480
Watch this, Buckmeinster.

971
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:09,858
It's showtime.

972
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:15,113
It's the fire!

973
01:09:15,196 --> 01:09:17,490
That's how he gets them
to follow his every move.

974
01:09:17,574 --> 01:09:21,327
Remember what Zee said?
The answer is in our chest fur.

975
01:09:37,093 --> 01:09:40,722
Three. Two. One. Play dead.

976
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:50,857
Oh, come on, guys.
We're not falling for that.

977
01:09:50,940 --> 01:09:53,193
We didn't fall for it the first time.

978
01:10:02,494 --> 01:10:04,829
What? You imbeciles.

979
01:10:04,913 --> 01:10:07,290
You're raptors, not possums. Get up!

980
01:10:08,416 --> 01:10:10,126
- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

981
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:11,670
Yeah!

982
01:10:11,753 --> 01:10:13,838
- Those are my boys!
- Whoo!

983
01:10:13,922 --> 01:10:16,007
Yes! Well done, lads!

984
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,259
That's called using your spleens!

985
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:22,389
Ha, what do you know, Eddie?
We do have a superpower.

986
01:10:22,472 --> 01:10:24,224
- Yeah!
- Playing dead!

987
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,642
What?

988
01:10:25,725 --> 01:10:28,436
Looks like you've been outsmarted.

989
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,814
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

990
01:10:43,743 --> 01:10:46,037
Uh… I'm okay!

991
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:48,123
Think again.

992
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:50,875
- Payback time.
- Oh, yeah.

993
01:10:52,794 --> 01:10:55,005
Where's your chew toy? Go get him.

994
01:10:57,132 --> 01:11:01,011
What? I don't know
if you got the memo. I'm your king.

995
01:11:01,094 --> 01:11:03,179
I command you...

996
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:05,682
Oh, whoa! That was close.
Hey, please don't eat me.

997
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:08,059
You'll be depriving the world
of a great genius.

998
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:11,021
I'm full of tiny bones
that'll get stuck in your throat.

999
01:11:11,521 --> 01:11:13,940
What have I told you about boundaries?

1000
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:19,154
Boys, that was a fine job.

1001
01:11:19,654 --> 01:11:22,574
Better than fine.
I'd say super, even.

1002
01:11:22,657 --> 01:11:25,160
You made this old weasel proud.

1003
01:11:25,243 --> 01:11:26,578
Who are you calling old?

1004
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:29,456
Crash! Eddie!

1005
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:36,212
- Ellie!
- Ellie!

1006
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:42,552
We're so sorry.

1007
01:11:42,635 --> 01:11:44,346
We shouldn't have left
without saying goodbye.

1008
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,056
You came all the way down here to find us.

1009
01:11:46,139 --> 01:11:47,223
You put yourself in danger.

1010
01:11:47,307 --> 01:11:49,017
You didn't think
we could take care of ourselves.

1011
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,852
With good reason.
And you worried about us.

1012
01:11:50,935 --> 01:11:52,562
'Cause you really care about us.

1013
01:11:52,645 --> 01:11:56,566
Boys, boys, slow down.
I'm the one who should be sorry.

1014
01:11:57,067 --> 01:12:00,820
I was scared of losing you.
I love you guys.

1015
01:12:01,529 --> 01:12:02,906
We love you too.

1016
01:12:03,490 --> 01:12:04,699
Hey.

1017
01:12:06,284 --> 01:12:08,119
You guys actually did it.

1018
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:09,913
I'm proud of you.

1019
01:12:11,164 --> 01:12:12,499
I never doubted them.

1020
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,252
Okay, I doubted them a little.

1021
01:12:16,336 --> 01:12:18,463
Boys, I didn't know you had it in you.

1022
01:12:18,546 --> 01:12:20,924
Mostly because you act like
total dimwits all the time.

1023
01:12:21,007 --> 01:12:24,177
Aw. I love family reunions.

1024
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:27,806
But there's no buffet,
so time to head home.

1025
01:12:27,889 --> 01:12:30,600
- About that...
- Hello, mates.

1026
01:12:30,684 --> 01:12:34,020
This is Zee.
She's a very dear friend.

1027
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:36,272
It's nice to meet you, Zee.

1028
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:40,443
The way you took charge out there,
I'd swear you were part possum.

1029
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,570
Actually, she's a zorilla.

1030
01:12:42,654 --> 01:12:44,948
It's like a skunk, only cooler.

1031
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:48,451
And my name may
or may not be Zsa Zsa.

1032
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,958
We were lucky to have possums
join our superhero squad.

1033
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,210
Really? A superhero squad?

1034
01:12:57,293 --> 01:12:58,962
She said it. I didn't.

1035
01:12:59,045 --> 01:13:01,172
You're probably gonna want our autographs.

1036
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,465
- No thanks.
- I'm good.

1037
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:05,218
Well, now that you've had
your big adventure,

1038
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:07,846
I suppose you'll be heading back home.

1039
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:11,558
After all,
you're probably bored of old Buck

1040
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:14,853
and his daring, action-packed,
thrill-a-minute lifestyle.

1041
01:13:15,854 --> 01:13:18,273
Uh…Yeah.

1042
01:13:18,356 --> 01:13:22,152
Yeah, I am. Boring.
Just so, so bored.

1043
01:13:22,235 --> 01:13:23,820
Total snoozefest.

1044
01:13:28,241 --> 01:13:33,580
Actually, the truth is,
Eddie and I have been thinking…

1045
01:13:33,663 --> 01:13:36,249
Which we're slowly getting better at.

1046
01:13:36,332 --> 01:13:38,209
Uh… Yeah.

1047
01:13:39,836 --> 01:13:43,548
The thing is,
we kinda, sorta like it here.

1048
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:49,137
Eddie, you talk now.

1049
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:56,603
We wanna stay down here,
but we wanna know that you'll be okay.

1050
01:13:59,147 --> 01:14:02,442
It seems like it was just yesterday
we were kids.

1051
01:14:03,068 --> 01:14:05,153
I thought we'd always be together.

1052
01:14:05,904 --> 01:14:07,906
Are you sure it's what you want?

1053
01:14:12,285 --> 01:14:14,079
Then I'll be fine.

1054
01:14:17,832 --> 01:14:20,126
We're staying!

1055
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:22,962
Oh, magic!

1056
01:14:23,046 --> 01:14:25,298
I've been a loner for too long.

1057
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,718
Zee made me realize
we're all stronger together than apart.

1058
01:14:29,344 --> 01:14:32,138
It's time for me
to have a real family.

1059
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,974
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Oh, yeah.

1060
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,935
- Go, Buck.
- Go, Buck.

1061
01:14:37,018 --> 01:14:39,104
- Go, Buck.
- Go, Buck. Yeah.

1062
01:14:39,187 --> 01:14:40,522
Buck, Buck, Buck!

1063
01:14:40,605 --> 01:14:44,943
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm gonna miss you guys.

1064
01:14:45,026 --> 01:14:47,028
Yeah, we'll miss you guys too.

1065
01:14:48,029 --> 01:14:51,574
Yeah, okay. Enough of this lovefest.

1066
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:54,619
Is that a tear in your eye, Diego?

1067
01:14:54,703 --> 01:14:56,538
No. And it never happened.

1068
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,748
Look at you. You're such a softy.

1069
01:15:40,081 --> 01:15:42,292
Promise me you'll visit all the time.

1070
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:43,918
We will.

1071
01:15:44,836 --> 01:15:46,546
Especially when we need something.

1072
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:17,285
<i>Change is scary,
but it is the way of the world.</i>

1073
01:16:17,369 --> 01:16:21,956
<i>And now I realize it can help us grow
into who we're meant to be,</i>

1074
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,584
<i>even if that takes us to new places.</i>

1075
01:16:25,085 --> 01:16:29,089
<i>The only thing that stays the same
is the love we have for each other.</i>

1076
01:16:29,839 --> 01:16:31,800
<i>That's the thing about a herd.</i>

1077
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:35,136
<i>You're a part of it,
even when you're apart.</i>

1078
01:16:39,265 --> 01:16:40,642
Can you believe it?

1079
01:16:41,184 --> 01:16:42,852
The boys are back.

1080
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:43,978
Again.

1081
01:16:44,562 --> 01:16:46,064
