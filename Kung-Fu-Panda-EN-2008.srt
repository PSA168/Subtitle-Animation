1
00:00:38,182 --> 00:00:41,618
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:44,848
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,552
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:01:00,404 --> 00:01:06,104
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:09,703
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,943
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:13,017 --> 00:01:15,315
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:15,386 --> 00:01:16,819
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,621
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:21,692 --> 00:01:25,389
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:27,657
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:30,495
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:31,335 --> 00:01:33,735
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:36,432
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:37,769
Kablooey!

16
00:01:37,841 --> 00:01:40,571
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:40,644 --> 00:01:43,511
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:56,026 --> 00:02:00,690
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:02:01,565 --> 00:02:04,261
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

20
00:02:04,335 --> 00:02:06,565
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:09,572
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,471
We should hang out.

23
00:02:11,542 --> 00:02:12,668
Agreed.

24
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:17,673
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:17,748 --> 00:02:22,185
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:25,050
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:26,881
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:28,720
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:30,054
What?

30
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:38,831
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:54,184 --> 00:02:57,642
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:58,983
Nothing.

33
00:03:02,526 --> 00:03:06,257
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:16,001
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:17,438
Coming!

36
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,977
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,886
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:31,955 --> 00:03:34,321
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:36,882
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,188
About what?

41
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:39,854
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:41,454
What was I?

43
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,290
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,325
...noodles.

45
00:03:47,805 --> 00:03:51,468
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,102
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:54,178 --> 00:03:56,646
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:58,181
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:58,248 --> 00:04:02,150
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:07,547
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:09,489
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,357
A sign of what?

53
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:16,058
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:18,397
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:18,469 --> 00:04:23,600
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:27,166
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:29,906
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,676
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

59
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,048
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:35,119 --> 00:04:38,680
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:38,756 --> 00:04:42,658
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,591
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:47,596
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

64
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:51,725
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:52,928
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:53,003 --> 00:04:54,766
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:55,539 --> 00:04:58,975
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:59,777 --> 00:05:01,472
Tofu.

69
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:04,946
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,575
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:08,879
I know, is here.

72
00:05:08,952 --> 00:05:12,080
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

73
00:05:12,156 --> 00:05:14,215
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,820
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:51,054
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:54,029
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:55,928
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:58,433
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:09,346 --> 00:06:12,782
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:23,559
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,754
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:25,829 --> 00:06:28,457
Well, I didn't say that.

83
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:48,179
You were saying?

84
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,345
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:51,421 --> 00:06:54,151
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:59,096 --> 00:07:01,656
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,496
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:05,369 --> 00:07:06,358
Zeng!

89
00:07:06,436 --> 00:07:08,768
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,172
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:12,242 --> 00:07:14,142
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:15,678
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:17,514 --> 00:07:22,679
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:22,753 --> 00:07:26,746
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:26,823 --> 00:07:27,812
He'll...

96
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:30,189
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

97
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,696
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:36,862
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,929
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:43,273 --> 00:07:45,036
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:47,467
It is time.

102
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:52,277
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:57,082
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:57,154 --> 00:07:58,621
I don't know.

105
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,383
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,317
Watch it!

107
00:08:04,394 --> 00:08:05,884
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:10,061
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:10,133 --> 00:08:11,122
What?

110
00:08:13,236 --> 00:08:16,501
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:21,169
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,304
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:28,511
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:28,585 --> 00:08:30,576
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:31,488 --> 00:08:33,820
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,188
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:40,821
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,296
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:47,402
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,598
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:58,005
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:59,776
That's my boy!

123
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:02,113
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:05,121
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:11,726
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:11,795 --> 00:09:14,320
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:48,832 --> 00:09:51,596
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:51,668 --> 00:09:53,533
Almost there.

129
00:09:53,603 --> 00:09:54,763
What?

130
00:09:54,838 --> 00:09:57,500
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:59,843 --> 00:10:03,404
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:07,851 --> 00:10:11,343
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,959
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:19,791
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:19,863 --> 00:10:24,732
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:26,792
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,633
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:29,806 --> 00:10:31,535
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:35,942
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,640
...but also to you.

141
00:10:42,352 --> 00:10:42,452
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:42,452 --> 00:10:46,115
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,932
Yeah.

144
00:11:01,438 --> 00:11:02,666
No, no, wait!

145
00:11:02,739 --> 00:11:05,071
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

146
00:11:05,142 --> 00:11:06,370
Yes!

147
00:11:09,379 --> 00:11:11,745
Hey! Open the door!

148
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,744
Let me in!

149
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,380
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

150
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:23,153
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

151
00:11:23,226 --> 00:11:27,390
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

152
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:28,795
The Furious Five!

153
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:43,045
Yeah, the Furious Five!

154
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:46,679
Warriors, prepare!

155
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,310
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

156
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,717
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

157
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:54,780
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

158
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,219
Look at that.

159
00:11:58,295 --> 00:12:00,286
Hey! Get out of the way!

160
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,831
And finally Master Tigress!

161
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:42,671
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

162
00:12:42,739 --> 00:12:44,001
I know!

163
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:49,171
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

164
00:13:01,591 --> 00:13:06,028
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

165
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,193
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

166
00:13:14,271 --> 00:13:18,799
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

167
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:21,937
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

168
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:24,703
Yeah.

169
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,255
Po!

170
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,266
What are you doing?!

171
00:13:44,334 --> 00:13:46,894
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

172
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,904
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

173
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:56,338
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

174
00:13:57,213 --> 00:14:00,239
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

175
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:06,580
I love kung fu!

176
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:23,604
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

177
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:27,608
OK.

178
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,446
Come back!

179
00:14:59,676 --> 00:15:01,473
What's going on?

180
00:15:02,245 --> 00:15:03,906
Where?

181
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:07,974
What are you pointing?

182
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,711
OK. Sorry.

183
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:15,257
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

184
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:17,259
How interesting.

185
00:15:17,327 --> 00:15:20,626
Master, are you pointing at me?

186
00:15:20,697 --> 00:15:22,722
- Him.
- Who?

187
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:26,929
- You.
- Me?

188
00:15:27,003 --> 00:15:32,498
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

189
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,175
- What?
- What?!

190
00:15:34,244 --> 00:15:35,939
- What?!
- What?!

191
00:15:45,822 --> 00:15:48,416
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

192
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,430
Master Oogway, wait.

193
00:15:59,536 --> 00:16:03,768
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

194
00:16:03,807 --> 00:16:07,538
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

195
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,043
That was just an accident!

196
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:11,876
There are no accidents.

197
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,760
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

198
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:33,166
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

199
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,568
then I will have failed you.

200
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:56,587
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

201
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:58,923
...from Master Shifu.

202
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,758
What?!

203
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,165
"Double the guard?!"

204
00:17:06,236 --> 00:17:08,033
"Extra precautions?!"

205
00:17:08,104 --> 00:17:10,436
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

206
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:17,001
You doubt my prison security?!

207
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,945
Absolutely not.

208
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:22,143
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

209
00:17:22,218 --> 00:17:25,847
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

210
00:17:26,489 --> 00:17:29,617
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

211
00:17:34,864 --> 00:17:36,798
Impressive, isn't it?

212
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,564
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:39,636 --> 00:17:41,126
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:41,204 --> 00:17:43,866
One way in, one way out.

215
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,036
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

216
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:50,636
Yes, except that prisoner...

217
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:52,408
...is Tai Lung.

218
00:17:56,486 --> 00:17:58,215
Take us down.

219
00:18:03,726 --> 00:18:05,091
What are you doing?

220
00:18:16,439 --> 00:18:17,906
Oh, my.

221
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:25,238
Behold Tai Lung.

222
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,976
I'm just gonna wait right here.

223
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:34,353
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

224
00:18:34,424 --> 00:18:36,688
Crossbows! At the ready!

225
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,556
Crossbows?

226
00:18:38,628 --> 00:18:41,188
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

227
00:18:41,264 --> 00:18:45,758
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

228
00:18:45,835 --> 00:18:47,496
Don't get him mad.

229
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:52,371
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

230
00:18:56,613 --> 00:19:00,572
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

231
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,480
I'm good. I've seen enough.

232
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:04,952
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

233
00:19:05,021 --> 00:19:06,249
No, he doesn't.

234
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:08,552
I'll tell him that.

235
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,490
Can we please go now?

236
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:28,978
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

237
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:29,501
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:35,218 --> 00:19:36,651
Wait a second!

239
00:19:41,658 --> 00:19:46,322
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

240
00:19:49,265 --> 00:19:52,598
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

241
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,002
Look at this place.

242
00:19:57,173 --> 00:20:01,610
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

243
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,541
The Sword of Heroes!

244
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:08,880
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

245
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,616
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

246
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:18,455
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

247
00:20:24,734 --> 00:20:26,292
No!

248
00:20:27,637 --> 00:20:30,401
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

249
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,636
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

250
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:38,139
Hello.

251
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:40,546
Have you finished sight-seeing?

252
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,709
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

253
00:20:42,785 --> 00:20:44,753
My patience is wearing thin.

254
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:47,654
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

255
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:50,090
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

256
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,183
How's it going?

257
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,694
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

258
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,062
Someone... broke that.

259
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:00,500
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

260
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:02,665
...glue?

261
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:06,664
A splinter.

262
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:09,735
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

263
00:21:09,812 --> 00:21:12,940
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

264
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:16,746
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

265
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:19,754
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

266
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:24,392
So, how does this work?

267
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,361
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

268
00:21:28,698 --> 00:21:32,725
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

269
00:21:32,802 --> 00:21:34,702
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

270
00:21:34,771 --> 00:21:37,797
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

271
00:21:37,874 --> 00:21:41,935
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

272
00:21:42,011 --> 00:21:43,035
Someone like me?

273
00:21:43,112 --> 00:21:47,776
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

274
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,318
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

275
00:21:50,386 --> 00:21:53,219
And this ridiculous belly.

276
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:56,554
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

277
00:21:56,626 --> 00:21:58,787
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

278
00:21:58,861 --> 00:22:01,386
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

279
00:22:01,497 --> 00:22:03,362
Listen, Oogway said I was...

280
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:06,095
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

281
00:22:06,169 --> 00:22:08,899
Oh, you know this hold?

282
00:22:08,971 --> 00:22:11,633
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

283
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,471
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

284
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:18,006
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

285
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,948
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

286
00:22:22,018 --> 00:22:24,145
OK, OK, take it easy.

287
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,654
Now listen closely, panda.

288
00:22:26,722 --> 00:22:29,850
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

289
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:34,829
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

290
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:38,125
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

291
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:39,930
Good.

292
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:41,936
I can't wait to get started.

293
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:23,808
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

294
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:25,410
What?

295
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:29,451
- Now?
- Yes, now.

296
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:33,818
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

297
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,448
Oh, OK, well...

298
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:39,517
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

299
00:23:39,595 --> 00:23:42,359
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

300
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:46,265
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

301
00:23:46,335 --> 00:23:47,393
What level is that?

302
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,928
Well, I'm not a master, but...

303
00:23:51,007 --> 00:23:53,771
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

304
00:23:53,843 --> 00:23:57,939
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

305
00:23:58,014 --> 00:24:00,778
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

306
00:24:00,883 --> 00:24:05,946
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

307
00:24:05,988 --> 00:24:07,353
But if you insist...

308
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:10,187
The Furious Five!

309
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:14,525
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

310
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,360
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

311
00:24:22,238 --> 00:24:25,605
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

312
00:24:25,675 --> 00:24:26,664
Hit it.

313
00:24:26,776 --> 00:24:31,406
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

314
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,246
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

315
00:24:35,318 --> 00:24:36,444
Just hit it.

316
00:24:37,286 --> 00:24:38,412
All right.

317
00:24:39,388 --> 00:24:42,789
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

318
00:24:42,858 --> 00:24:45,884
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

319
00:24:45,962 --> 00:24:48,157
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

320
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,222
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

321
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,097
You've only seen praying mantis.

322
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:55,103
Or monkey style.

323
00:24:55,771 --> 00:24:58,103
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

324
00:24:58,174 --> 00:25:00,540
Would you hit it!

325
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:02,770
All right. All right.

326
00:25:08,484 --> 00:25:11,578
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

327
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:14,584
How's that?

328
00:25:25,368 --> 00:25:26,858
That hurts.

329
00:25:33,876 --> 00:25:36,037
This will be easier than I thought.

330
00:25:36,112 --> 00:25:38,603
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

331
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:40,745
Those are hard!

332
00:25:45,121 --> 00:25:46,554
My tenders.

333
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,345
How did I do?

334
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:20,219
There is now a level zero.

335
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:20,389
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

336
00:26:20,389 --> 00:26:22,687
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:25,090
What was Master Oogway thinking?

338
00:26:25,161 --> 00:26:27,459
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

339
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:30,021
He is so mighty!

340
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:34,934
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

341
00:26:35,004 --> 00:26:37,837
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

342
00:26:38,841 --> 00:26:43,107
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

343
00:26:43,179 --> 00:26:45,204
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

344
00:26:45,281 --> 00:26:47,681
Or even see his toes.

345
00:27:12,041 --> 00:27:13,201
OK.

346
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:23,644
Great.

347
00:27:38,501 --> 00:27:40,093
Hi. You're up.

348
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:41,568
I am now.

349
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,136
I was just...

350
00:27:43,205 --> 00:27:45,105
Some day, huh?

351
00:27:45,174 --> 00:27:49,577
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

352
00:27:50,613 --> 00:27:55,414
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

353
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:59,485
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

354
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:02,022
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

355
00:28:02,057 --> 00:28:04,924
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

356
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:07,690
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

357
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:11,255
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

358
00:28:14,036 --> 00:28:16,368
Sorry about that.

359
00:28:16,438 --> 00:28:18,929
Look, you don't belong here.

360
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:23,544
I know. I know. You're right.

361
00:28:23,612 --> 00:28:26,103
I don't have... I just...

362
00:28:26,182 --> 00:28:27,706
My whole life I dreamed of...

363
00:28:27,783 --> 00:28:32,652
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

364
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:36,082
Property of Crane.

365
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:38,023
OK. Right, right.

366
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,618
So, you want to get to sleep.

367
00:28:40,696 --> 00:28:42,493
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

368
00:28:42,565 --> 00:28:44,692
We got big things tomorrow.

369
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:48,965
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

370
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:53,968
What was that?

371
00:28:54,043 --> 00:28:55,476
I didn't say anything.

372
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:57,705
OK. All right. Good night.

373
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,974
Sleep well.

374
00:29:01,784 --> 00:29:03,649
That seemed a little awkward.

375
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,112
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

376
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,886
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

377
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,257
This is your room.

378
00:29:12,328 --> 00:29:15,627
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

379
00:29:15,698 --> 00:29:18,064
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

380
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:21,762
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

381
00:29:22,104 --> 00:29:24,265
you will be gone by morning.

382
00:29:29,712 --> 00:29:31,339
Big fan!

383
00:29:38,754 --> 00:29:42,588
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

384
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:49,626
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

385
00:29:49,698 --> 00:29:54,635
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

386
00:29:54,703 --> 00:29:58,696
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

387
00:29:59,975 --> 00:30:02,375
So why are you so upset?

388
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:11,043
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

389
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,749
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

390
00:30:14,823 --> 00:30:15,915
Probably.

391
00:30:15,991 --> 00:30:19,688
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

392
00:30:19,762 --> 00:30:20,751
Totally.

393
00:30:20,829 --> 00:30:24,890
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

394
00:30:27,036 --> 00:30:28,936
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

395
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:32,565
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

396
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:35,576
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

397
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:40,580
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

398
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:45,913
Quit, don't quit.

399
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:50,015
Noodles, don't noodles.

400
00:30:50,092 --> 00:30:54,756
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

401
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,695
There's a saying:

402
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,199
Yesterday is history,

403
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:01,735
tomorrow is a mystery,

404
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,898
but today is a gift.

405
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:07,771
That is why it is called the present.

406
00:31:37,773 --> 00:31:40,139
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

407
00:31:40,209 --> 00:31:42,700
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:53,080
Fire crossbows!

409
00:31:53,155 --> 00:31:54,486
Fire!

410
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:58,150
Fire!

411
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:08,497
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

412
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,403
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

413
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,599
Bring it up!

414
00:32:15,344 --> 00:32:16,834
Wait! Bring it back!

415
00:32:35,631 --> 00:32:39,624
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

416
00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:50,600
We're dead. So very, very dead.

417
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:53,365
Not yet we're not. Now!

418
00:34:41,056 --> 00:34:43,752
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

419
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:06,012
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

420
00:35:08,283 --> 00:35:11,116
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

421
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:13,211
Fly back there and tell them...

422
00:35:13,288 --> 00:35:17,019
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

423
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:30,528
Good morning, Master!

424
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,634
Panda!

425
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,698
Panda!

426
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:36,271
Wake up!

427
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,043
He's quit.

428
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:48,114
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

429
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,284
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

430
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,988
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

431
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:57,021
What are you doing here?!

432
00:35:57,966 --> 00:35:59,957
Hi! Good morning, Master!

433
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,933
I thought I'd warm up a little.

434
00:36:04,072 --> 00:36:05,061
You're stuck.

435
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,506
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

436
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,308
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

437
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,314
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

438
00:36:14,449 --> 00:36:16,917
Maybe on three. One, two...

439
00:36:17,986 --> 00:36:19,180
...three.

440
00:36:20,956 --> 00:36:22,617
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

441
00:36:22,691 --> 00:36:25,626
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

442
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:29,994
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

443
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:33,432
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

444
00:36:33,502 --> 00:36:37,268
And years longer to apply it in combat!

445
00:36:46,682 --> 00:36:48,206
Put that down!

446
00:36:48,283 --> 00:36:52,777
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

447
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:55,789
Yeah! Excellent.

448
00:36:56,591 --> 00:36:57,785
Let's get started.

449
00:37:00,095 --> 00:37:01,960
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

450
00:37:03,932 --> 00:37:06,924
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

451
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:10,301
That was awesome! Let's go again!

452
00:37:36,665 --> 00:37:39,600
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

453
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:42,000
Your next opponent will be me.

454
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,833
All right! Yeah, let's go!

455
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,400
Step forth.

456
00:37:48,477 --> 00:37:51,935
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

457
00:37:52,013 --> 00:37:53,878
...and make him suffer for it.

458
00:37:53,949 --> 00:37:55,280
Oh, yeah!

459
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,717
To take his strength
and use it against him...

460
00:37:58,787 --> 00:38:01,278
...until he finally falls...

461
00:38:01,389 --> 00:38:02,378
...or quits.

462
00:38:02,424 --> 00:38:04,415
A real warrior never quits.

463
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:07,690
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

464
00:38:18,073 --> 00:38:21,270
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

465
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,674
But he will.

466
00:38:22,744 --> 00:38:25,042
He's not going to quit, is he?

467
00:38:25,113 --> 00:38:27,877
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

468
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:42,821
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

469
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:43,922
Trust me, it will.

470
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:47,628
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

471
00:38:47,702 --> 00:38:50,364
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

472
00:38:50,438 --> 00:38:51,427
Sure you were.

473
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:55,567
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

474
00:38:56,745 --> 00:38:57,734
I'm over here.

475
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:01,281
Maybe you should look at this again.

476
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,783
Oh, OK.

477
00:39:06,588 --> 00:39:08,579
Stop it. Stop!

478
00:39:09,758 --> 00:39:12,693
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

479
00:39:13,028 --> 00:39:16,691
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

480
00:39:21,636 --> 00:39:24,036
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

481
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:26,641
...but he wasn't always like that.

482
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:28,039
According to legend,

483
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:32,637
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

484
00:39:32,714 --> 00:39:34,648
- No!
- Yes.

485
00:39:34,716 --> 00:39:35,978
But that was before.

486
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,042
Before what?

487
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:39,450
Before Tai Lung.

488
00:39:39,554 --> 00:39:42,114
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

489
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,182
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

490
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,194
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

491
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:52,723
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

492
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:56,965
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

493
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:59,165
He wasn't just a student.

494
00:40:03,511 --> 00:40:06,344
Shifu found him as a cub...

495
00:40:07,983 --> 00:40:10,918
...and he raised him as his son.

496
00:40:13,288 --> 00:40:16,348
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

497
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:19,723
...Shifu trained him.

498
00:40:19,794 --> 00:40:23,924
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

499
00:40:25,634 --> 00:40:27,363
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

500
00:40:30,105 --> 00:40:31,697
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

501
00:40:31,773 --> 00:40:36,073
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

502
00:40:36,411 --> 00:40:40,108
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

503
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:44,609
He tried to take the scroll by force.

504
00:40:44,686 --> 00:40:49,282
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

505
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:52,817
But how could he?

506
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:11,139
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

507
00:41:19,387 --> 00:41:20,649
Or since.

508
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:31,997
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

509
00:41:32,067 --> 00:41:34,297
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

510
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:37,395
And he's stuck with you.

511
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:41,340
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

512
00:41:42,243 --> 00:41:43,232
That is it!

513
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:46,439
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

514
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,351
And may have also stopped his heart.

515
00:41:55,023 --> 00:41:56,581
Inner peace.

516
00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:59,850
Inner peace.

517
00:42:02,831 --> 00:42:04,526
Inner...

518
00:42:06,134 --> 00:42:08,034
Inner peace.

519
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:15,534
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

520
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,042
Inner...

521
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:26,711
Oh, Zeng.

522
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:28,380
Excellent.

523
00:42:28,456 --> 00:42:30,390
I could use some good news right now.

524
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,531
Master! Master!

525
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:44,467
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

526
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:46,905
Shifu.

527
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:50,376
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

528
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:54,108
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

529
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:57,583
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

530
00:42:59,054 --> 00:43:01,784
That is bad news...

531
00:43:01,856 --> 00:43:06,190
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

532
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:10,527
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

533
00:43:10,598 --> 00:43:13,897
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

534
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:16,266
There are no accidents.

535
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:20,633
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

536
00:43:20,708 --> 00:43:24,906
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

537
00:43:24,979 --> 00:43:26,071
Thrice.

538
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,774
My old friend,

539
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,445
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

540
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,081
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

541
00:43:36,157 --> 00:43:37,522
Illusion?

542
00:43:37,592 --> 00:43:40,584
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

543
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:43,688
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

544
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:47,030
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

545
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:49,627
But there are things we can control.

546
00:43:50,705 --> 00:43:53,799
I can control when the fruit will fall.

547
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:56,571
And I can control...

548
00:43:57,645 --> 00:43:59,636
...where to plant the seed.

549
00:44:00,148 --> 00:44:02,241
That is no illusion, Master.

550
00:44:03,885 --> 00:44:05,876
Yes.

551
00:44:05,954 --> 00:44:08,354
But no matter what you do

552
00:44:08,423 --> 00:44:11,358
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

553
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:16,295
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

554
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:19,993
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

555
00:44:20,068 --> 00:44:22,730
Maybe it can.

556
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:25,602
If you are willing to guide it.

557
00:44:25,673 --> 00:44:27,538
To nurture it.

558
00:44:27,609 --> 00:44:29,008
To believe in it.

559
00:44:29,077 --> 00:44:31,545
But how? How?

560
00:44:31,613 --> 00:44:33,581
I need your help, Master.

561
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:37,345
No, you just need to believe.

562
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,350
Promise me, Shifu.

563
00:44:40,955 --> 00:44:43,651
Promise me you will believe.

564
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:47,286
I will try.

565
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:49,619
Good.

566
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:53,858
My time has come.

567
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,439
You must continue
your journey without me.

568
00:45:00,542 --> 00:45:02,237
What are you? Wait!

569
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:05,642
Master!

570
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:08,039
You can't leave me!

571
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:14,447
You must believe.

572
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:16,982
Master!

573
00:45:47,422 --> 00:45:50,084
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

574
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:53,093
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

575
00:45:53,428 --> 00:45:55,259
...but you're a lousy tipper."

576
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:58,265
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

577
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:01,431
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

578
00:46:01,769 --> 00:46:03,236
...but I thought it...

579
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:05,067
...in my mind.

580
00:46:05,139 --> 00:46:08,199
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

581
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:10,937
Order up! Hope you like it.

582
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:16,078
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

583
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,450
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

584
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:22,921
What do you mean? This is amazing!

585
00:46:22,991 --> 00:46:25,926
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

586
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:27,894
Tigress, you've got to try this.

587
00:46:27,962 --> 00:46:31,591
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

588
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:36,467
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

589
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,741
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

590
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:46,803
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

591
00:46:51,219 --> 00:46:54,313
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

592
00:46:57,091 --> 00:47:01,118
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

593
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:05,799
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

594
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,700
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

595
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:10,670
...you will have ears like mine.

596
00:47:12,273 --> 00:47:13,672
That's good.

597
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:17,676
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

598
00:47:18,012 --> 00:47:19,138
It's Shifu!

599
00:47:19,213 --> 00:47:22,046
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

600
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,443
Master Shifu!

601
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:30,184
You think this is funny?

602
00:47:30,258 --> 00:47:33,227
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

603
00:47:33,294 --> 00:47:35,592
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

604
00:47:35,663 --> 00:47:38,029
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

605
00:47:41,703 --> 00:47:44,331
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

606
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:46,703
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

607
00:47:46,774 --> 00:47:49,607
What? You're serious? And I have to?

608
00:47:51,479 --> 00:47:54,448
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

609
00:47:54,515 --> 00:47:56,039
Oogway cannot!

610
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:57,950
Not anymore.

611
00:47:59,454 --> 00:48:02,150
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

612
00:48:02,223 --> 00:48:03,850
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

613
00:48:03,925 --> 00:48:07,520
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

614
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:11,156
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

615
00:48:11,232 --> 00:48:12,824
It is his!

616
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,026
Where'd he go?

617
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:24,675
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

618
00:48:24,746 --> 00:48:26,304
Watch me.

619
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,008
Come on.

620
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:33,918
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

621
00:48:33,988 --> 00:48:36,980
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

622
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:41,057
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

623
00:48:41,129 --> 00:48:44,121
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

624
00:48:44,198 --> 00:48:46,530
Yes! I was.

625
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:51,732
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

626
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:56,538
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

627
00:48:56,611 --> 00:49:00,945
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

628
00:49:01,048 --> 00:49:03,073
Yeah, I stayed.

629
00:49:03,117 --> 00:49:06,883
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

630
00:49:06,954 --> 00:49:11,357
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

631
00:49:11,426 --> 00:49:14,657
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

632
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:19,964
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

633
00:49:20,301 --> 00:49:23,361
...could make me... not me...

634
00:49:23,438 --> 00:49:24,803
...it was you.

635
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,008
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

636
00:49:28,075 --> 00:49:29,667
But I can change you!

637
00:49:29,744 --> 00:49:33,271
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

638
00:49:33,347 --> 00:49:37,340
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

639
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:40,819
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

640
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:45,154
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

641
00:49:47,462 --> 00:49:48,451
How?

642
00:49:50,097 --> 00:49:51,086
How?

643
00:49:54,135 --> 00:49:56,330
- How?!
- I don't know!

644
00:50:04,378 --> 00:50:05,936
I don't know.

645
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,750
That's what I thought.

646
00:50:53,394 --> 00:50:55,555
This is what you trained me for.

647
00:51:02,703 --> 00:51:03,692
Tigress!

648
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,739
Don't try and stop me.

649
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,004
We're not trying to stop you.

650
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:15,070
What?

651
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:17,014
We're coming with you!

652
00:52:30,191 --> 00:52:33,718
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

653
00:52:34,962 --> 00:52:36,327
No need to explain.

654
00:52:36,397 --> 00:52:40,561
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

655
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:03,184
Don't tell Monkey.

656
00:53:03,257 --> 00:53:06,420
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

657
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:09,486
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

658
00:53:09,563 --> 00:53:12,327
I don't know. I guess that...

659
00:53:12,667 --> 00:53:14,965
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

660
00:53:15,036 --> 00:53:16,936
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

661
00:53:17,972 --> 00:53:20,304
And you have done a perfect spilt.

662
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:23,343
No, this? This is just...

663
00:53:24,078 --> 00:53:25,409
...an accident.

664
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,710
There are no accidents.

665
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:33,845
Come with me.

666
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:45,298
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

667
00:53:45,366 --> 00:53:48,096
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

668
00:53:58,012 --> 00:54:00,480
You dragged me...

669
00:54:00,581 --> 00:54:02,276
...all the way out here...

670
00:54:02,316 --> 00:54:03,647
...for a bath?

671
00:54:07,288 --> 00:54:08,619
Panda...

672
00:54:08,689 --> 00:54:12,318
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

673
00:54:13,561 --> 00:54:14,585
The Pool of...

674
00:54:14,662 --> 00:54:17,256
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

675
00:54:17,331 --> 00:54:19,526
...of harmony and focus.

676
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,125
This is the birthplace...

677
00:54:22,203 --> 00:54:23,465
...of kung fu.

678
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:39,715
Do you want to learn kung fu?

679
00:54:39,787 --> 00:54:40,776
Yeah!

680
00:54:40,855 --> 00:54:44,120
Then I am your master!

681
00:54:44,191 --> 00:54:45,954
OK!

682
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:48,386
Don't cry.

683
00:54:48,462 --> 00:54:49,793
OK.

684
00:54:55,536 --> 00:54:57,527
When you focus on kung fu,

685
00:54:57,605 --> 00:54:59,732
when you concentrate...

686
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,307
...you stink.

687
00:55:01,342 --> 00:55:03,242
Perhaps that is my fault.

688
00:55:03,310 --> 00:55:06,768
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

689
00:55:06,847 --> 00:55:09,941
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

690
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:11,314
...is with this.

691
00:55:11,385 --> 00:55:14,149
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

692
00:55:15,055 --> 00:55:16,113
Good.

693
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:18,886
When you have been trained, you may eat.

694
00:55:20,327 --> 00:55:21,487
Let us begin.

695
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:33,291
After you, panda.

696
00:56:33,367 --> 00:56:35,335
Just like that?

697
00:56:35,402 --> 00:56:39,065
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

698
00:56:39,139 --> 00:56:43,633
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

699
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:50,641
Enjoy.

700
00:56:52,219 --> 00:56:53,652
Hey!

701
00:56:53,721 --> 00:56:56,849
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

702
00:56:58,192 --> 00:56:59,659
Hey!

703
00:57:05,933 --> 00:57:07,901
You are free to eat.

704
00:57:07,968 --> 00:57:09,868
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

705
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:37,780
I'm not hungry.

706
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:42,589
Master.

707
00:59:12,726 --> 00:59:14,023
Cut it!

708
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:33,042
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

709
00:59:33,113 --> 00:59:36,105
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

710
00:59:36,183 --> 00:59:38,378
You think I'm a fool?

711
00:59:38,452 --> 00:59:42,081
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

712
00:59:42,156 --> 00:59:45,421
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

713
00:59:45,492 --> 00:59:49,929
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

714
00:59:49,997 --> 00:59:55,594
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

715
00:59:55,669 --> 00:59:58,763
Finally, a worthy opponent.

716
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:01,330
Our battle will be legendary!

717
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:23,023
We've got this. Help her.

718
01:00:47,654 --> 01:00:48,643
Monkey!

719
01:00:48,722 --> 01:00:50,553
Go!

720
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:51,818
What was I thinking?!

721
01:01:02,236 --> 01:01:03,260
Mantis!

722
01:01:08,509 --> 01:01:09,942
Now!

723
01:01:55,856 --> 01:01:58,154
Shifu taught you well.

724
01:02:01,128 --> 01:02:03,062
But he didn't teach you everything.

725
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:08,657
You have done well, panda.

726
01:02:08,735 --> 01:02:12,432
Done well? Done well?

727
01:02:12,506 --> 01:02:13,803
I've done awesome!

728
01:02:15,509 --> 01:02:18,706
The mark of a true hero is humility.

729
01:02:18,779 --> 01:02:21,475
But, yes, you have done...

730
01:02:22,082 --> 01:02:23,413
...awesome.

731
01:02:30,657 --> 01:02:33,990
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

732
01:02:34,061 --> 01:02:37,497
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

733
01:02:37,564 --> 01:02:39,555
We were no match for his nerve attach.

734
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:41,863
He's gotten stronger.

735
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:44,233
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

736
01:02:45,439 --> 01:02:46,428
He's too fast!

737
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:48,064
Sorry, Po.

738
01:02:50,143 --> 01:02:51,701
I thought we could stop him.

739
01:02:51,778 --> 01:02:53,609
He could have killed you.

740
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,738
Why didn't he?

741
01:02:54,815 --> 01:02:59,218
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

742
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:03,619
It might. I mean, a little.

743
01:03:03,657 --> 01:03:04,885
I'm pretty scared.

744
01:03:04,958 --> 01:03:06,448
You can defeat him, panda!

745
01:03:06,526 --> 01:03:09,461
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

746
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:12,521
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

747
01:03:12,599 --> 01:03:15,966
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

748
01:03:21,308 --> 01:03:23,799
You really believe I'm ready?

749
01:03:23,877 --> 01:03:25,538
You are...

750
01:03:25,612 --> 01:03:26,909
...Po.

751
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:19,423
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

752
01:04:19,499 --> 01:04:21,433
It is yours.

753
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:24,436
Wait. What happens when I read it?

754
01:04:24,504 --> 01:04:28,531
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

755
01:04:28,608 --> 01:04:30,838
Really? That's cool.

756
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:33,744
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

757
01:04:33,814 --> 01:04:36,715
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

758
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:38,817
Can I punch through walls?

759
01:04:38,885 --> 01:04:41,251
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

760
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:42,515
- Will I?
- Focus.

761
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,322
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

762
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:47,292
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

763
01:04:47,361 --> 01:04:49,556
Read it and become...

764
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,358
...the Dragon Warrior.

765
01:04:58,271 --> 01:04:59,704
It's impossible to open.

766
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:03,905
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

767
01:05:06,146 --> 01:05:07,773
Thank you.

768
01:05:07,848 --> 01:05:10,248
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

769
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:13,075
OK, here goes.

770
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:26,759
- It's blank.
- What?!

771
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:30,428
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

772
01:05:36,143 --> 01:05:39,010
Blank. I don't...

773
01:05:39,112 --> 01:05:41,273
I don't understand.

774
01:05:42,582 --> 01:05:45,278
OK. So, like...

775
01:05:45,352 --> 01:05:48,583
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

776
01:05:48,655 --> 01:05:51,249
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

777
01:05:51,324 --> 01:05:55,385
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

778
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:59,592
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

779
01:06:00,634 --> 01:06:02,329
But who will stop Tai Lung?

780
01:06:02,402 --> 01:06:04,893
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

781
01:06:04,971 --> 01:06:06,632
No.

782
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:12,469
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

783
01:06:12,546 --> 01:06:14,946
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

784
01:06:15,015 --> 01:06:17,711
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

785
01:06:17,784 --> 01:06:19,251
for everyone to escape.

786
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,753
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

787
01:06:21,822 --> 01:06:24,655
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

788
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,718
Listen to me, all of you.

789
01:06:27,794 --> 01:06:31,321
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

790
01:06:31,398 --> 01:06:34,390
I am very proud
to have been your master.

791
01:06:55,188 --> 01:06:57,554
We've got to get them out safely.

792
01:06:57,624 --> 01:06:59,956
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

793
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:03,552
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

794
01:07:03,597 --> 01:07:05,360
Crane, light the way.

795
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:27,443
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

796
01:07:36,162 --> 01:07:37,561
Hey, Dad.

797
01:07:38,164 --> 01:07:39,461
Po!

798
01:07:45,372 --> 01:07:47,465
Good to have you back, son.

799
01:07:49,943 --> 01:07:51,433
Good to be back.

800
01:07:51,511 --> 01:07:53,138
Let's go, Po.

801
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,482
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

802
01:07:58,752 --> 01:08:02,244
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

803
01:08:02,589 --> 01:08:04,682
...no longer slices.

804
01:08:04,758 --> 01:08:08,194
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

805
01:08:08,261 --> 01:08:11,424
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

806
01:08:12,732 --> 01:08:13,926
You like that?

807
01:08:20,073 --> 01:08:24,669
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

808
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:27,770
It just wasn't meant to be.

809
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:33,742
Po, forget everything else.

810
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:36,015
Your destiny still awaits.

811
01:08:36,089 --> 01:08:40,856
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

812
01:08:40,961 --> 01:08:43,225
I don't know, Dad.

813
01:08:43,296 --> 01:08:47,289
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

814
01:08:50,670 --> 01:08:51,762
Po...

815
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:56,275
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

816
01:08:56,343 --> 01:08:58,402
...a long time ago.

817
01:08:58,478 --> 01:09:00,207
OK.

818
01:09:01,581 --> 01:09:05,711
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

819
01:09:08,455 --> 01:09:13,085
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

820
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:14,148
...nothing.

821
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:18,063
You heard me. Nothing!

822
01:09:18,131 --> 01:09:20,599
There is no secret ingredient!

823
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:23,727
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

824
01:09:23,803 --> 01:09:26,670
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

825
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:31,143
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

826
01:09:41,821 --> 01:09:44,312
There is no secret ingredient.

827
01:10:06,913 --> 01:10:09,711
I have come home, Master.

828
01:10:09,783 --> 01:10:13,048
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

829
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:17,055
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

830
01:10:17,123 --> 01:10:20,217
So where is this Po?

831
01:10:21,661 --> 01:10:22,889
Did I scare him off?

832
01:10:22,962 --> 01:10:25,294
This battle is between you and me.

833
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,136
So, that is how it's going to be.

834
01:10:30,203 --> 01:10:32,228
That is how it must be.

835
01:10:46,386 --> 01:10:50,948
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

836
01:10:51,024 --> 01:10:53,390
Obeying your master is not weakness!

837
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:56,258
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

838
01:10:56,329 --> 01:10:58,490
You always knew.

839
01:10:58,565 --> 01:11:03,502
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

840
01:11:04,637 --> 01:11:07,162
What did you do?!

841
01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:10,835
Nothing!

842
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:13,743
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

843
01:11:13,813 --> 01:11:15,781
Not your fault?!

844
01:11:15,849 --> 01:11:17,908
Who filled my head with dreams?!

845
01:11:17,984 --> 01:11:20,214
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

846
01:11:20,286 --> 01:11:23,016
Who denied me my destiny?!

847
01:11:32,265 --> 01:11:34,859
It was never my decision to make!

848
01:11:40,340 --> 01:11:41,637
It is now.

849
01:11:46,713 --> 01:11:50,479
Give me the scroll!

850
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:51,778
I would rather die.

851
01:12:41,935 --> 01:12:45,029
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

852
01:12:45,205 --> 01:12:47,696
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

853
01:12:48,675 --> 01:12:50,165
Tell me!

854
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,439
Tell me!

855
01:13:02,755 --> 01:13:06,122
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

856
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,593
From the first moment, I've been...

857
01:13:10,663 --> 01:13:12,961
...proud of you.

858
01:13:13,032 --> 01:13:15,398
And it was my pride...

859
01:13:15,468 --> 01:13:17,493
...that blinded me.

860
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:21,131
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

861
01:13:22,141 --> 01:13:24,405
...what I...

862
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:26,468
...was turning you into.

863
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:29,248
I'm...

864
01:13:29,315 --> 01:13:30,304
I'm sorry.

865
01:13:38,825 --> 01:13:41,555
I don't want your apology.

866
01:13:41,628 --> 01:13:43,152
I want my scroll!

867
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:47,597
What?!

868
01:13:47,667 --> 01:13:48,895
Where is it?!

869
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:54,499
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

870
01:13:55,642 --> 01:13:58,770
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

871
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:00,176
Never.

872
01:14:01,114 --> 01:14:02,103
Never.

873
01:14:09,055 --> 01:14:10,352
Stairs.

874
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:14,589
Who are you?

875
01:14:14,661 --> 01:14:19,689
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

876
01:14:22,702 --> 01:14:24,033
You?

877
01:14:25,004 --> 01:14:26,972
Him? He's a panda.

878
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:30,908
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

879
01:14:30,977 --> 01:14:32,911
Don't tempt me.

880
01:14:32,979 --> 01:14:37,006
No. I'm gonna use this.

881
01:14:37,083 --> 01:14:38,710
You want it? Come and get it.

882
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:41,750
Finally!

883
01:15:07,714 --> 01:15:09,181
That scroll is mine!

884
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:03,959
Lightning!

885
01:16:39,172 --> 01:16:41,163
The scroll has given him power!

886
01:16:41,808 --> 01:16:43,366
No!

887
01:17:19,846 --> 01:17:23,782
Finally! Oh, yes.

888
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:28,719
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

889
01:17:33,025 --> 01:17:35,050
It's nothing!

890
01:17:37,029 --> 01:17:39,623
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

891
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:41,423
What?

892
01:17:42,668 --> 01:17:44,465
There is no secret ingredient.

893
01:17:48,007 --> 01:17:49,235
It's just you.

894
01:17:59,018 --> 01:18:00,076
Stop it!

895
01:18:00,153 --> 01:18:01,916
I'm gonna pee.

896
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:05,116
Don't.

897
01:18:05,191 --> 01:18:06,852
Don't! Don't!

898
01:19:14,126 --> 01:19:15,923
You...

899
01:19:15,995 --> 01:19:18,225
...can't defeat me.

900
01:19:22,668 --> 01:19:23,896
You...

901
01:19:25,238 --> 01:19:27,035
...you're just a big...

902
01:19:27,106 --> 01:19:28,698
...fat...

903
01:19:28,774 --> 01:19:29,763
...panda!

904
01:19:30,743 --> 01:19:33,871
I'm not a big fat panda.

905
01:19:33,946 --> 01:19:36,244
I'm the big fat panda.

906
01:19:38,517 --> 01:19:39,950
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

907
01:19:40,019 --> 01:19:41,452
Oh, you know this hold?

908
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,479
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

909
01:19:45,558 --> 01:19:47,253
Nope.

910
01:19:47,326 --> 01:19:49,521
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

911
01:20:10,049 --> 01:20:11,277
Look!

912
01:20:12,318 --> 01:20:14,411
The Dragon Warrior.

913
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:46,750
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

914
01:20:48,821 --> 01:20:49,913
Yes!

915
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:52,748
Thanks, Dad.

916
01:21:02,034 --> 01:21:03,433
Hey, guys.

917
01:21:08,174 --> 01:21:09,505
Master.

918
01:21:09,575 --> 01:21:11,008
Master.

919
01:21:13,913 --> 01:21:15,676
Master?

920
01:21:15,748 --> 01:21:17,215
Master Shifu!

921
01:21:30,262 --> 01:21:31,627
Master!

922
01:21:31,697 --> 01:21:33,790
Shifu, are you OK?!

923
01:21:36,168 --> 01:21:37,567
Po.

924
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:39,570
You're alive.

925
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:40,866
Or we're both dead.

926
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:44,876
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

927
01:21:44,944 --> 01:21:46,070
You did?

928
01:21:50,349 --> 01:21:56,083
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

929
01:21:56,155 --> 01:21:59,647
You are the Dragon Warrior.

930
01:22:00,393 --> 01:22:02,861
You have brought peace...

931
01:22:02,928 --> 01:22:05,692
...to this valley...

932
01:22:05,765 --> 01:22:07,960
...and...

933
01:22:08,033 --> 01:22:09,660
...and to me.

934
01:22:09,735 --> 01:22:10,997
Thank you.

935
01:22:12,838 --> 01:22:16,069
Thank you, Po.

936
01:22:16,142 --> 01:22:18,736
Thank you. Thank you.

937
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:29,244
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

938
01:22:29,321 --> 01:22:32,051
I'm not dying, you idiot!

939
01:22:32,124 --> 01:22:34,092
Dragon Warrior...

940
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:40,196
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

941
01:22:42,935 --> 01:22:45,870
So, I should stop talking?

942
01:22:46,572 --> 01:22:48,199
If you can.

943
01:23:06,292 --> 01:23:07,884
Want to get something to eat?

944
01:23:10,563 --> 01:23:11,655
Yeah.

945
01:23:17,670 --> 01:23:21,071
Everybody is kung fu fighting

946
01:23:21,907 --> 01:23:25,240
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

947
01:23:26,245 --> 01:23:29,578
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

948
01:23:30,749 --> 01:23:34,241
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

949
01:23:37,356 --> 01:23:40,416
Everybody is kung fu fighting

950
01:23:41,694 --> 01:23:44,925
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

951
01:23:45,931 --> 01:23:49,264
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

952
01:23:50,603 --> 01:23:53,595
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

953
01:23:55,441 --> 01:23:57,636
You are a natural

954
01:23:57,710 --> 01:23:59,940
Why is that so hard to see?

955
01:24:00,045 --> 01:24:04,175
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

956
01:24:04,216 --> 01:24:08,312
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know

957
01:24:08,387 --> 01:24:12,289
But sometimes you've got to go
And be your own hero

958
01:24:12,358 --> 01:24:15,293
Everybody is kung fu fighting

959
01:24:16,662 --> 01:24:19,859
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

960
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:24,301
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

961
01:24:25,404 --> 01:24:28,635
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

962
01:24:30,309 --> 01:24:34,609
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

963
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:38,776
You could be a work of art
If you just go all the way

964
01:24:38,851 --> 01:24:42,651
Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

965
01:24:42,721 --> 01:24:47,090
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

966
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:50,287
'Cause everybody is kung fu fighting

967
01:24:51,597 --> 01:24:54,623
Your mind becomes fast as lightning

968
01:24:55,834 --> 01:24:58,962
Although the future
is a little bit frightening

969
01:25:00,339 --> 01:25:03,467
It's the book of your life
that you're writing

970
01:25:05,277 --> 01:25:08,872
You're a diamond in the rough
A brilliant ball of clay

971
01:25:09,615 --> 01:25:14,075
You could be a work of art

Now what would it take to break?
I believe that you can bend

973
01:25:18,257 --> 01:25:22,023
Not only do you have to fight
But you have got to win

974
01:25:22,094 --> 01:25:25,188
