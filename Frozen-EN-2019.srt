1
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:00,691
Anna. Elsa.

2
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,959
Bedtime soon.

3
00:01:02,059 --> 00:01:03,861
Uh-oh. The princess
is trapped

4
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:05,529
in the snow goblin's evil spell.

5
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:08,366
Quick, Elsa!
Make a prince! A fancy one!

6
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,534
Oh, no! The prince
is trapped, too.

7
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:12,270
Who cares about danger

8
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:13,537
when there's love?

9
00:01:13,637 --> 00:01:15,406
Ugh, Anna. Bleugh!

10
00:01:15,506 --> 00:01:17,041
Kissing won't save the Forest.

11
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,644
The lost fairies cry out.

12
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:22,055
What sound does a giraffe make?

13
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,281
Never mind.

14
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:24,501
They wake the fairy queen...

15
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:27,385
who breaks the spell
and saves everyone!

16
00:01:27,485 --> 00:01:29,720
And they all get married!

17
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,955
What are you playing?

18
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:32,556
Enchanted Forest.

19
00:01:32,656 --> 00:01:34,458
The prince and the princess...

20
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:36,570
Hmm. That's like no enchanted forest
I've ever seen.

21
00:01:36,594 --> 00:01:39,297
You've seen
an enchanted forest?

22
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,564
Wait, what?

23
00:01:40,664 --> 00:01:42,433
I have. Once.

24
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:45,001
And you've never
told us this before?

25
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:47,038
Well, I could
tell you now, if you...

26
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:50,408
Okay. Now.
Tell us now.

27
00:01:50,508 --> 00:01:52,610
Are you sure about this?

28
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,445
It's time they know.

29
00:01:54,545 --> 00:01:56,089
Let's make
a big snowman later.

30
00:01:56,113 --> 00:01:57,748
If they can settle and listen.

31
00:02:00,818 --> 00:02:01,919
Far away...

32
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:03,754
as north as we can go...

33
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:08,059
stood a very old
and very enchanted forest.

34
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,560
But its magic wasn't that of

35
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,496
goblin spells and lost fairies.

36
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:15,633
It was protected by the most
powerful spirits of all...

37
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:18,336
those of air...

38
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:19,569
of fire...

39
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,772
of water...

40
00:02:22,706 --> 00:02:24,442
and earth.

41
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:30,681
But it was also home

42
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:32,849
to the mysterious
Northuldra people.

43
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:35,486
Were
the Northuldra magical, like me?

44
00:02:35,586 --> 00:02:37,955
No, Elsa.
They were not magical.

45
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:42,559
They just took advantage
of the Forest's gifts.

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,463
Their ways
were so different from ours...

47
00:02:45,563 --> 00:02:48,766
but still,
they promised us friendship.

48
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:50,067
In honor of that,

49
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,002
your grandfather, King Runeard,

50
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:53,537
built them a mighty dam...

51
00:02:53,637 --> 00:02:55,506
to strengthen their waters.

52
00:02:55,606 --> 00:02:56,874
It was a gift of peace.

53
00:02:56,974 --> 00:02:59,543
That's a big gift of peace.

54
00:02:59,643 --> 00:03:00,978
And I was so honored

55
00:03:01,078 --> 00:03:03,013
to get to go to the Forest
to celebrate it.

56
00:03:03,113 --> 00:03:05,416
Stand tall, Agnarr.

57
00:03:05,516 --> 00:03:06,851
I wasn't
at all prepared

58
00:03:06,951 --> 00:03:08,552
for what the day would bring.

59
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,690
We let down our guard.

60
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:16,160
We were charmed.

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,661
Whoa. Whoa!

62
00:03:19,163 --> 00:03:20,831
It felt so...

63
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:21,931
magical.

64
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,115
But something went wrong.

65
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,652
They were attacking us.

66
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:43,821
Get behind me.

67
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:48,492
It was
a brutal battle.

68
00:03:48,592 --> 00:03:49,903
Your grandfather...

69
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:50,927
Father!

70
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:51,961
Was lost.

71
00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:53,531
Aah!

72
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:55,433
The fighting
enraged the spirits.

73
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,802
Look out!

74
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:59,937
They turned
their magic against us all.

75
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:11,916
There was this voice...

76
00:04:16,653 --> 00:04:19,190
and someone saved me.

77
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:25,796
I'm told the spirits
then vanished.

78
00:04:25,896 --> 00:04:29,633
And a powerful mist
covered the Forest.

79
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:32,002
Locking everyone out.

80
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,512
And that night, I came home
King of Arendelle.

81
00:04:43,246 --> 00:04:46,883
Whoa, Papa, that was epic.

82
00:04:46,984 --> 00:04:48,819
Whoever saved you,

83
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:51,088
I love them.

84
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:53,491
I wish I knew who it was.

85
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:55,192
What happened to the spirits?

86
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:56,893
What's in the Forest now?

87
00:04:56,994 --> 00:04:58,529
I don't know.

88
00:04:58,629 --> 00:05:01,030
The mist still stands.

89
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,799
No one can get in.

90
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,902
And no one has since come out.

91
00:05:05,002 --> 00:05:06,103
So we're safe.

92
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,505
Yes.

93
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,138
But the Forest could wake again.

94
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:13,244
And we must be prepared
for whatever danger it may bring.

95
00:05:13,344 --> 00:05:14,678
And on that note,

96
00:05:14,778 --> 00:05:16,189
how about we say good night
to your father?

97
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,782
But I still have so many questions.

98
00:05:19,883 --> 00:05:21,719
Save them
for another night, Anna.

99
00:05:21,819 --> 00:05:24,788
You know I don't have that
kind of patience.

100
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:28,659
Why did Northuldra
attack us anyway?

101
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,728
Who attacks people
who give them gifts?

102
00:05:30,828 --> 00:05:33,763
Do you think
the Forest will wake again?

103
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,235
Only Ahtohallan knows.

104
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:40,571
Octa-who-what?

105
00:05:41,905 --> 00:05:44,275
When I was little...

106
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,809
my mother would sing a song

107
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,712
about a special river
called Ahtohallan...

108
00:05:48,812 --> 00:05:51,749
that was said to hold all
the answers about the past.

109
00:05:51,849 --> 00:05:53,817
About what we are a part of.

110
00:05:53,917 --> 00:05:54,917
Wow.

111
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,087
Will you sing it
for us? Please?

112
00:05:58,822 --> 00:05:59,522
Okay.

113
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:01,592
Cuddle close.

114
00:06:01,692 --> 00:06:04,562

They're ready.

140

Excuse me.

141
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,978
I'm coming.

142
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:06,092
Do you hear that?

143
00:08:06,116 --> 00:08:07,116
What?

144
00:08:09,152 --> 00:08:10,187
Never mind.

145

Enjoying
your new permafrost, Olaf?

I'm just living
the dream, Anna.

How I wish

148
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,483
this could last forever.
Mmm.

149
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,152
And yet, change mocks us
with her beauty.

150

Forgive me.
Maturity is making me poetic.

and thus all-knowing...

153
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:50,427
do you ever worry

nothing is permanent?

155

I'm ancient like you...

And Sven promised
to read me a bedtime story.

275
00:14:11,848 --> 00:14:13,617
Didn't you, Sven?

276
00:14:13,717 --> 00:14:14,717
Did I?

277

and stuff."

281
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:24,561
Um, how about you guys

282
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:26,396
start without me?

283
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:32,769
Ugh.

284
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:34,771
Did Elsa seem weird to you?

285
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,474
She seemed like Elsa.
Hmm.

286
00:14:37,574 --> 00:14:39,242
That last word

287
00:14:39,342 --> 00:14:41,211
really seemed to throw her.
What was it?

288
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:42,779
I don't know. Ahem.
No. No.

289
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,581
I don't know, but...
Ah.

Oh, come on!

292
00:14:47,851 --> 00:14:49,820
She couldn't act out ice?

293
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,455
I better go check on her.
Uh...

294
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,557
Thanks, honey.
Love you. Hmm?

295
00:14:55,758 --> 00:14:57,494

With you?
No, with you.

300

You do that
when something's wrong.

302
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,712
Did we hurt
your feelings?

303
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,046
I'm so sorry if we did.

304
00:15:17,146 --> 00:15:19,649
You know, very few people
are actually good at family games.

305
00:15:19,749 --> 00:15:20,749
That's just a fact.

306

No, that's not it.

307
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,654
Then, what is it?

308
00:15:27,256 --> 00:15:29,459
There's this...

309
00:15:32,361 --> 00:15:34,497

mess things up.

310

314
00:15:46,643 --> 00:15:48,879
You'll always have me.

The air rages,
no fire, no water.

The earth is next.

371
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:45,575
We have to get out.

372
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,986
It'll be okay.
Evacuate to the cliffs.

373

Oh, no!
I'm gonna blow!

374

I've got you!

375

Yes.
Everyone's out and safe.

376
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,974
- Here. Take one of these.
- Huh?

377
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:19,209
You okay there, Olaf?

378
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:21,043
Oh, yeah.
We're calling this...

379
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:24,948
"controlling what you can
when things feel out of control."

380
00:21:25,048 --> 00:21:26,249
Okay, I don't understand.

381
00:21:26,349 --> 00:21:27,983
You've been hearing a voice

382
00:21:28,084 --> 00:21:29,953
and you didn't think to tell me?

383
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:31,654
I didn't want to worry you.

384
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:34,224
We made a promise
not to shut each other out.

385
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,728
Just tell me what's going on.

386
00:21:38,828 --> 00:21:42,098
I woke the magical spirits
at the Enchanted Forest.

387
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,500
Okay, that's definitely not

388
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,968
what I thought
you were gonna say.

389
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:47,604
Wait. The Enchanted Forest?

390
00:21:47,704 --> 00:21:49,239
The one Father warned us about?

391
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:50,339
Yes.

392
00:21:50,373 --> 00:21:51,941
Why would you do that?

393
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,243
Because of the voice.

394
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:57,213
I know it sounds crazy...

395
00:21:57,313 --> 00:22:00,250
but I believe whoever
is calling me is good.

396
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,785
How can you say that?
Look at our kingdom.

397
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:07,123
I know. It's just that
my magic can feel it.

398
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:09,626
I can feel it.

399
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:10,994
Okay.

400
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:14,230
Oh, no. What now?

401
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,032
The Trolls?

402
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:19,035
Kristoff! We missed you!
Oh!

403
00:22:19,802 --> 00:22:20,670
Pabbie.

404
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,940
Well, never a dull moment
with you two.

405
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,975
I hope you're prepared
for what you have done, Elsa.

406
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:30,713
Angry magical spirits are not
for the faint of heart.

407
00:22:30,813 --> 00:22:32,749
Why are they still angry?

408
00:22:32,849 --> 00:22:35,083
What does all of this
have to do with Arendelle?

409
00:22:35,184 --> 00:22:36,985
Let me see what I can see.

410
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:43,560
The past is not what it seems.

411
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:46,896
A wrong demands to be righted.

412
00:22:46,996 --> 00:22:50,066
Arendelle is not safe.

413
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:53,570
The truth must be found.

414
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,871
Without it...

415
00:22:56,138 --> 00:22:58,274
I see no future.

416
00:22:58,974 --> 00:23:00,310
No future?

417
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:02,712
When one can see no future...

418
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:06,683
all one can do
is the next right thing.

419
00:23:06,783 --> 00:23:08,818
The next right thing

420
00:23:08,918 --> 00:23:10,620
is for me to go
to the Enchanted Forest...

421
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,288
and find that voice.

422
00:23:12,388 --> 00:23:13,668
Kristoff, can I borrow
your wagon

423
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:14,924
- and Sven?
- Hmm?

424
00:23:15,024 --> 00:23:16,335
I'm not very comfortable
with the idea of that.

425
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:18,661
You are not going alone.
Anna, no.

426
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:21,064
I have my powers
to protect me. You don't.

427
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,965
Excuse me, I climbed
the North Mountain...

428
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:23,866
survived a frozen heart,

429
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,635
and saved you
from my ex-boyfriend...

430
00:23:25,735 --> 00:23:27,015
and I did it all without powers,

431
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,180
so, you know, I'm coming.

432
00:23:28,204 --> 00:23:29,371
Me, too. I'll drive.

433
00:23:29,472 --> 00:23:30,974
I'll bring the snacks!

434
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,209
I will look after your people.

435
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:34,610
Please make sure they stay

436
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:36,055
out of the kingdom
until we return.

437
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,379
Of course.

438
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,948
Let's let them know.

439
00:23:39,048 --> 00:23:42,051
Anna, I am worried for her.

440
00:23:42,151 --> 00:23:43,386
We have always feared

441
00:23:43,486 --> 00:23:46,022
Elsa's powers were too much
for this world.

442
00:23:46,122 --> 00:23:49,892
Now, we must pray
they are enough.

443
00:23:51,461 --> 00:23:54,097
I won't let anything
happen to her.

444
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:55,765
Hyah!

445
00:23:59,134 --> 00:24:01,003
Who's into trivia?

446
00:24:01,104 --> 00:24:02,639
I am. Okay.

447
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:05,008
Did you know that water
has memory? True fact.

448
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,342
It's disputed by many,
but it's true.

449
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:08,911
Did you know men are six times

450
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:10,747
more likely to be struck by lightning?

451
00:24:10,847 --> 00:24:12,714
Did you know gorillas burp
when they're happy?

452
00:24:12,815 --> 00:24:15,018
Did you know we blink
four million times a day?

453
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:17,020
Did you know
wombats poop squares?

454
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,497
Did you know
sleeping quietly

455
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:20,289
on long journeys
prevents insanity?

456
00:24:21,858 --> 00:24:23,102
- Yeah, that's not true.
- It is.

457
00:24:23,126 --> 00:24:24,761
- It's true.
- Definitely true.

458
00:24:24,861 --> 00:24:26,038
No, it's the truth.

459
00:24:26,062 --> 00:24:27,430
Well,
that was unanimous.

460
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:29,432
But I will look it up
when we get home.

461
00:24:32,068 --> 00:24:33,802
They're both asleep.

462
00:24:33,903 --> 00:24:36,939
So, what do you wanna do?

463
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:42,011
Sven, keep us steady, will ya?

464
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,448
- Hmm...
- Anna. Ahem.

465
00:24:45,548 --> 00:24:46,782
Anna?
Mm-hmm?

466
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:48,451
Remember
our first trip like this...

467
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:50,753
when I said
you'd have to be crazy

468
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,388
to want to marry
a man you just met?

469
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:54,090
Wait, what? Crazy?

470
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,926
You didn't say I was crazy.
You think I'm crazy?

471
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:58,361
No. I did.

472
00:24:58,461 --> 00:25:00,229
- You were...
- Huh?

473
00:25:00,329 --> 00:25:01,397
not crazy.

474
00:25:01,497 --> 00:25:02,932
Clearly.

475
00:25:03,032 --> 00:25:04,467
Just naive.

476
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:08,070
Not naive. Just, uh,
new to love. Like I was.

477
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:12,742
And when you're new,
you're bound to get it wrong.

478
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:14,777
So you're saying
I'm wrong for you.

479
00:25:14,877 --> 00:25:16,812
What? No, no.
I'm not saying

480
00:25:16,913 --> 00:25:19,147
you're wrong, or crazy.

481
00:25:19,248 --> 00:25:21,484
Kristoff, stop. Please.
Good idea.

482
00:25:21,584 --> 00:25:23,252
I hear it.
I hear the voice.

483
00:25:23,352 --> 00:25:25,088
You do?

484
00:25:25,188 --> 00:25:28,224
Olaf, wake up.

485
00:25:31,027 --> 00:25:33,229
Whoa.
Wow.

486
00:25:57,352 --> 00:25:59,322
Whoa! What the...

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,876
Whoa.

488
00:26:26,615 --> 00:26:29,452
Promise me,
we do this together, okay?

489
00:26:29,552 --> 00:26:31,120
I promise.

490
00:26:40,295 --> 00:26:41,898
It's okay.

491
00:26:41,998 --> 00:26:44,033
Did you know
that an enchanted forest

492
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:45,868
is a place of transformation?

493
00:26:45,968 --> 00:26:47,804
I have no idea
what that means...

494
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:49,505
but I can't wait to see

495
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:53,342
what it's gonna do
to each one of us.

496
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:56,012
- Hey!
- What is this?

497
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,456
- No pushing.
- Stop it.

498
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,281
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's too fast.

499
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,449
What was that?

500
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,187
No. No, no, no.

501
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:07,824
And we're locked in.

502
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:09,591
Probably should have seen
that one coming.

503
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,163
This forest is beautiful.

504
00:27:14,663 --> 00:27:16,065
Ooh.

505
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:43,459
The dam. It still stands.

506
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,329
It was
in Grand Pabbie's visions.

507
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:48,064
But why?

508
00:27:48,164 --> 00:27:50,599
I don't know, but it's still
in good shape. Thank goodness.

509
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,868
What do you mean?

510
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:53,102
Well, if that dam broke...

511
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,070
it would send
a tidal wave so big

512
00:27:55,171 --> 00:27:57,506
it would wash away
everything on this fjord.

513
00:27:57,606 --> 00:27:59,041
Everything?

514
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:01,310
But Arendelle's on this fjord.

515
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,579
Nothing's gonna happen
to Arendelle, Anna.

516
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,014
It's gonna be fine.

517
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:07,083
Come here.

518
00:28:12,455 --> 00:28:15,124
You know,
under different circumstances,

519
00:28:15,224 --> 00:28:18,527
this would be a, uh,
pretty romantic place.

520
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:19,627
Don't you think?

521
00:28:19,662 --> 00:28:20,997
Different circumstances?

522
00:28:21,097 --> 00:28:22,207
You mean,
like with someone else?

523
00:28:22,231 --> 00:28:23,666
What? No! No.

524
00:28:23,766 --> 00:28:25,134
I'm saying...

525
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:26,545
Just in case we don't make it
out of here...

526
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:27,570
Wait, what?

527
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:29,214
You don't think we're gonna
make it out of here?

528
00:28:29,238 --> 00:28:30,406
No. No!

529
00:28:30,506 --> 00:28:32,308
I mean, no,
we will make it out of here.

530
00:28:32,408 --> 00:28:33,719
Well, technically the odds are kind
of complicated,

531
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:34,976
but my point is...

532
00:28:35,077 --> 00:28:36,412
In case we die...

533
00:28:36,512 --> 00:28:38,481
You think we're gonna die?
No! No, no, no.

534
00:28:38,581 --> 00:28:40,182
Where's Elsa?
We will die at some point.

535
00:28:40,282 --> 00:28:41,660
I swore that
I wouldn't leave her side.

536
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,228
Not in any
recent time will we die.

537
00:28:43,252 --> 00:28:44,119
Elsa!
But way far in the future,

538
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,354
we will die.

539
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:51,394
Don't patronize me.

540
00:29:00,235 --> 00:29:01,437
Elsa!

541
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:02,704
There you are.

542
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:05,107
You okay?
I'm fine.

543
00:29:05,207 --> 00:29:07,176
Okay, good.

544
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,145
Where's Olaf?

545
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,279
Um...

546
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:11,380
Anna?

547
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,282
Elsa?

548
00:29:13,382 --> 00:29:15,251
Sven?

549
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,386
Samantha?

550
00:29:19,255 --> 00:29:22,325
I don't even know a Samantha.

551
00:29:25,428 --> 00:29:26,462
Whoa!

552
00:29:29,197 --> 00:29:30,199
Mm.

553
00:29:32,801 --> 00:29:34,437
That's normal.

554
00:29:46,715 --> 00:29:48,718
What was that?

555
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,187
Samantha?

Whoa!
Olaf!

578
00:31:32,387 --> 00:31:33,489
Hey, guys.

579
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:35,424
Meet the Wind Spirit.

580
00:31:37,193 --> 00:31:38,828
Coming through!

581
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:40,463
Ooh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

582
00:31:40,563 --> 00:31:43,265
I'd hold your hair back,
but I can't find my arms.

583
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:53,142
Hey! Stop!

584
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,554
Elsa!

585
00:32:09,424 --> 00:32:11,227
Let her go!

586
00:32:15,264 --> 00:32:17,433
Anna,
be careful!

587
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,502
That's my sister!

588
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:25,341
Prince Agnarr!

589
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,778
For Arendelle.

590
00:32:32,647 --> 00:32:33,682
Look out!

591
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:36,644
Father!

592
00:32:45,527 --> 00:32:47,863
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

593
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:51,433
What are these?

594
00:32:51,533 --> 00:32:55,471
Oh, they look like
moments in time.

595
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:57,540
What's that thing you say, Olaf?

596
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,741
The thing... Oh!

597
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:00,910
My theory about advancing
technologies

598
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,411
as both our savior and our doom?

599
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:04,812
No, not that one. The one about...

600
00:33:04,913 --> 00:33:06,182
The one about cucumbers?
No.

601
00:33:06,282 --> 00:33:07,316
The thing about water.

602
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:09,585
Oh! Yeah.
Water has memory.

603
00:33:09,685 --> 00:33:11,419
The water that makes up you and me

604
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,589
has passed through
at least four humans...

605
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,624
and/or animals before us.

606
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:17,725
Hmm.

607
00:33:17,826 --> 00:33:20,262
And remembers everything.

608
00:33:21,463 --> 00:33:23,599
The wind's back.

609
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:25,768
Delicious.

610
00:33:25,868 --> 00:33:28,671
I think I'll name you Gale.

611
00:33:30,673 --> 00:33:32,741
Get out of there. Whoa!

612
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,877
Oh. Hi.
Aren't you curious?

613
00:33:36,612 --> 00:33:38,714
You in a better mood now?

614
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:52,294
Father.
That's Father.

615
00:33:53,895 --> 00:33:55,364
This girl.

616
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,633
She's saving him.

617
00:33:57,733 --> 00:33:58,801
She's Northuldra.

618
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:02,671
What is that?

619
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:04,706
Olaf, get behind me.

620
00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:08,610
What are you gonna do with that?

621
00:34:08,711 --> 00:34:09,845
I have no idea.

622
00:34:23,759 --> 00:34:25,427
Lower your weapon.

623
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:27,930
And you lower yours.

624
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,265
Arendellian soldiers?

625
00:34:30,366 --> 00:34:32,001
Threatening my people,
Lieutenant?

626
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,669
Invading my dance space, Yelena?

627
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:36,047
Why does that soldier
look so familiar?

628
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:37,506
No, no, no.

629
00:34:37,606 --> 00:34:38,406
Lieutenant!

630
00:34:38,506 --> 00:34:39,608
Get the sword!

631
00:34:47,381 --> 00:34:48,950
That was magic.

632
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:50,419
Did you see that?

633
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:52,553
Of course I saw it.

634
00:34:52,654 --> 00:34:54,423
You chose a nice, cold greeting.

635
00:34:54,522 --> 00:34:56,291
They've been trapped in here
this whole time?

636
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:57,826
Yeah.
What do we do now?

637
00:34:57,926 --> 00:34:59,361
I got this.

638
00:34:59,461 --> 00:35:00,863
Hi, I'm Olaf.

639
00:35:02,664 --> 00:35:05,700
Oh, sorry. Yeah, I just
find clothes restricting.

640
00:35:05,801 --> 00:35:07,903
Bet you're wondering
who we are and why we're here.

641
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:09,805
It's really quite simple.

642
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:12,041
It began with two sisters.

643
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:13,941
One born with magical powers.

644
00:35:14,042 --> 00:35:15,444
One born powerless.

645
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:17,413
Their love of snowmen, infinite.

646
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:18,947
Anna, no! Too high!

647
00:35:19,047 --> 00:35:20,349
Blast!

648
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,749
Mama! Papa! Help!

649
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:24,019
Slam!
Doors shutting everywhere.

650
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,088
Sisters torn apart.

651
00:35:26,188 --> 00:35:28,356
Well, at least
they have their parents.

652
00:35:28,457 --> 00:35:30,059
Their parents are dead.

653
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,994
Oh.
Oh, hi. I'm Anna.

654
00:35:32,094 --> 00:35:33,461
I'll marry a man I just met.

655
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:34,939
Elsa's gonna blow!

656
00:35:34,963 --> 00:35:37,333
Snow! Snow! Aah, run!

657
00:35:37,433 --> 00:35:39,368
Magic pulses
through my snowflakes.

658
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:40,836
I live.

659
00:35:40,936 --> 00:35:43,639
Ice palace for one.
Ice palace for one.

660
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:45,607
Get out, Anna.
Pew! Pew!

661
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:47,710
My heart.
Oh, my goodness.

662
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,654
Only an act
of true love can save you.

663
00:35:49,678 --> 00:35:51,680
Here's
a true love's kiss.

664
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,549
You're not worth it.

665
00:35:53,649 --> 00:35:55,050
Guess what?
I'm the bad guy.

666
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,719
What?

667
00:35:56,819 --> 00:35:59,888
And Anna
freezes to death forever.

668
00:35:59,988 --> 00:36:02,124
Oh, Anna.

669
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:03,225
Then she unfreezes!

670
00:36:03,325 --> 00:36:05,361
Oh, and then Elsa woke up
the magical spirits...

671
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,938
and we were forced
out of our kingdom.

672
00:36:06,962 --> 00:36:08,506
Now our only hope is to find
the truth about the past...

673
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,674
but we don't have a clue
how to do that...

674
00:36:09,698 --> 00:36:10,999
except Elsa's hearing voices,

675
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:12,699
so we got that going for us.

676
00:36:12,734 --> 00:36:14,136
Any questions?

677
00:36:16,938 --> 00:36:18,673
I think they got it.

678
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:21,909
Are you really
Queen of Arendelle?

679
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:23,045
I am.

680
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,380
Why would nature reward

681
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,981
a person of Arendelle
with magic?

682
00:36:26,081 --> 00:36:28,483
Perhaps to make up
for the actions of your people.

683
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,386
My people are innocent.

684
00:36:30,486 --> 00:36:32,421
We would have never
attacked first.

685
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,722
May the truth be found.

686
00:36:33,822 --> 00:36:36,024
Mm...
Hi. I'm sorry.

687
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:37,726
Uh, what's happening?
Hmm.

688
00:36:37,826 --> 00:36:39,862
That's it.
Lieutenant Mattias!

689
00:36:39,962 --> 00:36:41,730
Library, second portrait
on the left.

690
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,700
You were our father's
official guard.

691
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,535
Agnarr.

692
00:36:46,635 --> 00:36:48,437
What did happen to your parents?

693
00:36:48,537 --> 00:36:51,673
Our parents' ship went
down in the Southern Sea...

694
00:36:51,773 --> 00:36:52,807
six years ago.

695
00:36:57,579 --> 00:37:00,682
I see him.
I see him in your faces.

696
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:01,782
Really?

697
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,884
Soldiers.

698
00:37:03,017 --> 00:37:06,121
We may be getting on in years,
but we're still strong.

699
00:37:06,221 --> 00:37:08,657
And proud to serve Arendelle.

700
00:37:09,824 --> 00:37:11,592
Wait. Please.

701
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:13,662
Someone has called me here.

702
00:37:13,762 --> 00:37:15,764
If I can just find them...

703
00:37:15,864 --> 00:37:17,132
I believe they have the answers

704
00:37:17,232 --> 00:37:20,068
that may help us
free this forest.

705
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:22,438
Trust me, I just want to help.

706
00:37:22,538 --> 00:37:24,840
We only trust nature.

707
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,708
When nature speaks...

708
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:30,211
we listen.

709
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:32,748
This will all
make sense when I'm older.

710
00:37:34,249 --> 00:37:35,551
Fire Spirit!

711
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:38,620
Get back, everyone!

712
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,756
Head for the river!

713
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,901
No! No! No! The reindeer!
That's a dead end!

714
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,470
Come on, Sven!

715
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,604
We'll get them.

716
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,809
Elsa! Get out of there!

717
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:02,811
No, no, no.

718
00:38:07,749 --> 00:38:08,917
Elsa!

719
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:22,865
Come on, buddy,
we can do this. Hyah!

720
00:38:27,769 --> 00:38:28,770
Anna!

721
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,043
Oh!

722
00:38:35,143 --> 00:38:36,178
Get her out of here.

723
00:38:36,278 --> 00:38:38,714
No! Elsa!

724
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,923
They're all looking at us,
aren't they?

725
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:58,293
Got any advice?

726
00:40:00,028 --> 00:40:01,897
Nothing?

727
00:40:01,997 --> 00:40:04,333
Hmm. Should I know
what that means?

728
00:40:07,102 --> 00:40:09,304
You hear it, too.

729
00:40:09,404 --> 00:40:11,373
Somebody's calling us.

730
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:14,209
Who is it?
What do we do?

731
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,820
Okay, keep going north.

732
00:40:27,355 --> 00:40:28,690
Elsa!

733
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:29,958
Oh, thank goodness!
Anna.

734
00:40:30,058 --> 00:40:31,760
Are you okay?
What were you doing?

735
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,961
You could've been killed.

736
00:40:33,061 --> 00:40:34,963
You can't just follow me
into fire.

737
00:40:35,063 --> 00:40:37,298
You don't want me
to follow you into fire,

738
00:40:37,399 --> 00:40:40,302
then don't run into fire.

739
00:40:40,402 --> 00:40:43,372
You're not being careful, Elsa.

740
00:40:45,273 --> 00:40:48,175
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

741
00:40:48,276 --> 00:40:50,178
I've been better.

742
00:40:50,278 --> 00:40:53,382
Hmm. I know
what you need.

743
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,420
Where did you get that scarf?

744
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:01,156
That's a Northuldra scarf.

745
00:41:01,256 --> 00:41:02,123
What?

746
00:41:02,223 --> 00:41:05,227
This is from one of
our oldest families.

747
00:41:05,327 --> 00:41:07,062
It was our mother's.

748
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:17,271
Elsa.

749
00:41:17,372 --> 00:41:18,440
I see it.

750
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,909
It's Mother.

751
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:24,179
Mother saved
Father's life that day.

752
00:41:28,182 --> 00:41:30,452
Our mother was Northuldra.

753
00:42:31,445 --> 00:42:33,782
We are called Northuldra.

754
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:36,985
We are the people of the sun.

755
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:42,457
I promise you
I will free this forest...

756
00:42:42,557 --> 00:42:44,126
and restore Arendelle.

757
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,329
That's a pretty
big promise, Elsa.

758
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,234
Free the Forest?
Wow.

759
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:53,334
I'm sorry.

760
00:42:53,368 --> 00:42:55,079
It's just, uh, some of us
were born in here,

761
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:57,271
we've never even seen
a clear sky.

762
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,507
I get it.

763
00:42:58,607 --> 00:43:00,408
The name's Ryder.
Kristoff.

764
00:43:00,508 --> 00:43:02,077
I heard the voice again.

765
00:43:02,177 --> 00:43:03,211
We need to go north.

766
00:43:03,344 --> 00:43:05,981
But the Earth Giants
now roam the north at night.

767
00:43:06,081 --> 00:43:08,150
You can leave in the morning.

768
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:08,984
I'm Honeymaren.

769
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:11,887
Honeymaren, we'll do all we can.

770
00:43:15,323 --> 00:43:16,491
Hey, let me ask you.

771
00:43:16,591 --> 00:43:17,959
How do you guys cope...

772
00:43:18,059 --> 00:43:19,961
with the ever-increasing
complexity of thought

773
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:22,931
that comes with maturity?

774
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:24,566
Brilliant!

775
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:26,168
Oh!

776
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:28,079
It's so refreshing to talk
to the youth of today.

777
00:43:28,103 --> 00:43:29,503
Our future's in bright hands.

778
00:43:29,604 --> 00:43:30,972
Oh, no, no.
Don't chew that.

779
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:32,874
You don't know
what I've stepped in.

780
00:43:32,974 --> 00:43:34,543
I can't seem
to get her attention.

781
00:43:34,643 --> 00:43:36,244
Or even say the right thing.

782
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:37,845
Well, you're in luck.

783
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:39,915
I know nothing about women.

784
00:43:40,015 --> 00:43:41,055
But I do know that we have

785
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:43,819
the most amazing way
of proposing.

786
00:43:43,919 --> 00:43:45,020
If we start now,

787
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,320
we'll be ready by dawn.
Really?

788
00:43:46,354 --> 00:43:47,556
Best part,

789
00:43:47,656 --> 00:43:49,133
it involves
a lot of reindeer.

790
00:43:49,157 --> 00:43:50,992
Whoa.

791
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,212
Hey,
back at home...

792
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,262
Halima still over
at Hudson's Hearth?

793
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,362
She is.

794
00:43:55,397 --> 00:43:57,132
Really?
She married?

795
00:43:57,232 --> 00:43:57,999
Mm-mm.

796
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:01,369
Oh, wow. Why didn't that
make me feel better?

797
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,204
What else do you miss?

798
00:44:03,905 --> 00:44:05,440
My father.

799
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,375
He passed long before all this.

800
00:44:08,643 --> 00:44:11,146
He was a great man.

801
00:44:11,246 --> 00:44:12,948
Built us a good life
in Arendelle.

802
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:15,917
But taught me to never take
the good for granted.

803
00:44:16,017 --> 00:44:18,220
He'd say, "Be prepared.

804
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,964
"Just when you think
you've found your way,

805
00:44:19,988 --> 00:44:23,024
"life will throw you
onto a new path."

806
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:25,260
What do you do when it does?

807
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,595
Don't give up.

808
00:44:26,695 --> 00:44:30,097
Take it one step
at a time and...

809
00:44:30,198 --> 00:44:33,101
Just do the next right thing?

810
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:34,469
Yeah.

811
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:35,937
You got it.

812
00:44:39,006 --> 00:44:42,177
I wanna show you
something. May I?

813
00:44:44,946 --> 00:44:47,382
You know air, fire,
water, and earth.

814
00:44:47,482 --> 00:44:48,984
Yes.

815
00:44:49,084 --> 00:44:50,294
But, look,
there's a fifth spirit...

816
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:53,921
said to be a bridge
between us
and the magic of nature.

817
00:44:54,022 --> 00:44:55,323
A fifth spirit?

818
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,591
Some say

819
00:44:56,691 --> 00:44:59,327
they heard it call out
the day the Forest fell.

820
00:44:59,427 --> 00:45:01,062
My father heard it.

821
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:03,265
Do you think
that is who's calling me?

822
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:07,936
Maybe. Alas,
only Ahtohallan knows.

823
00:45:08,036 --> 00:45:09,905
Ahtohallan.

824
00:45:11,272 --> 00:45:15,443
♪ Dive down deep
into her sound

825
00:45:15,543 --> 00:45:20,181
♪ But not too far
or you'll be drowned ♪

826
00:45:20,281 --> 00:45:22,083
Why do lullabies
always have to have

827
00:45:22,183 --> 00:45:23,485
some terrible warning in them?

828
00:45:23,585 --> 00:45:25,620
I wonder that all the time.

829
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,091
Earth Giants.

830
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:32,060
What are they doing down here?

831
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,629
Shh!

832
00:45:34,729 --> 00:45:36,064
Hide.

833
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,175
They're coming!

834
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,120
This is why
we don't play with fire.

835
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,524
Oh, I can't stay mad at you.
Why are you so cute?

836
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:31,586
Please tell me you were not
about to follow them.

837
00:46:31,686 --> 00:46:34,155
What if I can settle them
like I did the wind and fire?

838
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:35,990
Or what if they can crush you

839
00:46:36,091 --> 00:46:38,159
before you even get the chance?

840
00:46:38,259 --> 00:46:41,696
Remember, the goal
is to find the voice...

841
00:46:41,796 --> 00:46:44,699
find the truth, and get us home.

842
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:47,102
Hey, guys.
That was close.

843
00:46:47,202 --> 00:46:48,370
I know.

844
00:46:48,470 --> 00:46:50,738
The giants sensed me.
They may come back here.

845
00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:53,174
I don't want to put anyone
at risk again.

846
00:46:53,274 --> 00:46:54,609
And you're right, Anna.

847
00:46:54,709 --> 00:46:56,578
We've got to find the voice.

848
00:46:56,678 --> 00:46:57,746
We're going now.

849
00:46:57,846 --> 00:46:59,381
Okay. We're going.

850
00:46:59,481 --> 00:47:00,715
Let me just...

851
00:47:02,884 --> 00:47:05,453
Wait. Where are
Kristoff and Sven?

852
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:08,089
Oh, yeah. I think they
took off with that Ryder guy

853
00:47:08,189 --> 00:47:09,457
and a bunch of reindeer.

854
00:47:09,557 --> 00:47:10,692
They left?
Mm-hmm.

855
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,228
Just left
without saying anything?

856
00:47:13,328 --> 00:47:15,730
Who knows the ways of men?

857
00:47:22,503 --> 00:47:25,407
Am I supposed to feel
this ridiculous?

858
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:26,807
Oh, yeah. Definitely.

859
00:47:27,575 --> 00:47:28,610
Everyone ready?

860
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:30,045
Ready!

861
00:47:30,145 --> 00:47:31,255
Uh,
I could use a rehearsal.

862
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:32,359
I love love.

863
00:47:32,413 --> 00:47:34,082
Wait. You talk
for them, too?

864
00:47:34,182 --> 00:47:35,550
I do.

865
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,128
It's like you can actually
hear what they're thinking.

866
00:47:37,152 --> 00:47:39,287
Yeah. And then
you just say it.

867
00:47:39,387 --> 00:47:41,089
And then you just say it.

868
00:47:43,491 --> 00:47:45,727
Okay. Here she comes.

869
00:47:47,228 --> 00:47:49,296
Princess Anna of Arendelle...

870
00:47:49,397 --> 00:47:53,701
my feisty, fearless,
ginger-sweet love.

871
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,404
Will you marry me?

872
00:47:57,471 --> 00:47:58,540
Um...

873
00:47:58,640 --> 00:47:59,774
No.

874
00:47:59,874 --> 00:48:01,810
The princess left
with the queen.

875
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,812
What? Wait,
what? What?

876
00:48:03,912 --> 00:48:07,348
I wouldn't try to follow.
They're long gone.

877
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:08,650
Long gone?

878
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:12,320
So, yeah.

879
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,090
Um, we're heading west
to the Lichen Meadows.

880
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,691
You can come with us
if you want.

881
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:24,466
Hey. Um...
I'm really sorry that...

882
00:48:24,566 --> 00:48:27,302
No, it's fine.
Yeah. Yep.

883
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:30,438
Okay,
I better go pack. You coming with?

884
00:48:30,538 --> 00:48:32,307
I'll just... Yeah,
I'll meet you there.

885
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:34,309
Okay, uh, you know
where you're going, right?

886
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:35,777
Yeah. Yeah.
Yep.

887
00:48:35,877 --> 00:48:37,345

937
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,816
I agree.
She's a little pitchy.

938
00:52:34,983 --> 00:52:36,818
Hey, Gale's back.

939
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:43,726
What?

940
00:52:52,501 --> 00:52:54,403
How can it be?

941
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:55,637
What is it?

942
00:52:56,638 --> 00:52:58,574
Mother
and Father's ship.

943
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:01,410
But this isn't the Southern Sea.

944
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:03,778
No, it isn't.

945
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:18,527
Why is their ship here?

946
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:22,164
How is it here?

947
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:24,867
It must have been washed in
from the Dark Sea.

948
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:27,603
What were they doing
in the Dark Sea?

949
00:53:29,137 --> 00:53:30,905
I don't know.

950
00:53:31,006 --> 00:53:33,675
How did the ship
get through the mist?

951
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:36,412
I thought nobody could but us.

952
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:39,481
Unless nobody was on it.

953
00:53:40,482 --> 00:53:42,484
There's gotta be something here.

954
00:53:42,584 --> 00:53:44,887
Wait. Wait.
Look around.

955
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,856
Every Arendellian ship
has a compartment.

956
00:53:47,956 --> 00:53:49,724
Waterproof.

957
00:53:49,825 --> 00:53:51,627
That's very clever.

958
00:53:51,727 --> 00:53:53,028
Although, it does make me wonder

959
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:55,431
why they don't just make
the whole ship waterproof.

960
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:02,905
Here.

961
00:54:08,877 --> 00:54:10,979
What language is this?

962
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:12,548
I don't know.

963
00:54:12,648 --> 00:54:14,983
But look,
this is Mother's handwriting.

964
00:54:15,083 --> 00:54:16,584
"The end of the ice age.

965
00:54:16,685 --> 00:54:18,687
"The river found, but lost.

966
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:22,691
"Magic's source.
Elsa's source?"

967
00:54:25,059 --> 00:54:26,762
It's a map.

968
00:54:28,596 --> 00:54:30,199
They traveled north

969
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:34,102
and planned to cross
the Dark Sea to...

970
00:54:34,202 --> 00:54:36,104
Ahtohallan.

971
00:54:36,204 --> 00:54:37,873
It's real?

972
00:54:37,973 --> 00:54:39,074
Octa-who-what?

973
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,542
Ahtohallan.

974
00:54:40,642 --> 00:54:42,478
It's a magical river

975
00:54:42,578 --> 00:54:44,880
said to hold all the answers
about the past.

976
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:48,851
Reinforcing my
"water has memory" theory. Mm.

977
00:54:48,951 --> 00:54:50,686
Water has memory.

978
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,127
Elsa?

979
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:01,864
I wanna know
what happened to them.

980
00:55:09,304 --> 00:55:11,639
Ahtohallan has to be
the source of her magic.

981
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:13,542
We keep going
for Elsa.

982
00:55:13,642 --> 00:55:14,877
The waves are too high!

983
00:55:14,977 --> 00:55:16,979
- Iduna!
- Agnarr!

984
00:55:20,315 --> 00:55:21,950
Elsa!

985
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:32,126
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

986
00:55:32,227 --> 00:55:33,862
This is my fault.

987
00:55:33,962 --> 00:55:36,565
They were looking
for answers about me.

988
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:39,668
You are not responsible
for their choices, Elsa.

989
00:55:39,768 --> 00:55:42,070
No. Just their deaths.

990
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:43,838
Stop. No.

991
00:55:43,939 --> 00:55:46,608
Yelena asked,
why would the spirits

992
00:55:46,708 --> 00:55:49,010
reward Arendelle
with a magical queen?

993
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:52,614
Because our mother
saved our father.

994
00:55:52,714 --> 00:55:54,783
She saved her enemy.

995
00:55:54,883 --> 00:55:59,021
Her good deed
was rewarded with you.

996
00:55:59,121 --> 00:56:00,789
You are a gift.

997
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:01,655
For what?

998
00:56:01,756 --> 00:56:04,092
If anyone can resolve
the past...

999
00:56:04,192 --> 00:56:07,729
if anyone can save Arendelle
and free this forest,

1000
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:09,131
it's you.

1001
00:56:09,231 --> 00:56:13,669
I believe in you, Elsa.
More than anyone or anything.

1002
00:56:20,274 --> 00:56:22,911
Honeymaren said
there was a fifth spirit.

1003
00:56:23,011 --> 00:56:26,181
A bridge between
the magic of nature and us.

1004
00:56:26,281 --> 00:56:27,816
A fifth spirit?

1005
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,751
That's who's been calling me
from Ahtohallan.

1006
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:33,889
The answers about the past are all there.

1007
00:56:34,689 --> 00:56:35,991
So we go to Ahtohallan.

1008
00:56:37,191 --> 00:56:39,194
Not "we."

1009
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,796
- Me.
- What?

1010
00:56:40,896 --> 00:56:43,164
The Dark Sea
is too dangerous for us both.

1011
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:46,068
No. No!
We do this together.

1012
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:47,369
Remember the song?

1013
00:56:47,469 --> 00:56:49,704
"Go too far and you'll be drowned."

1014
00:56:49,805 --> 00:56:51,840
Who will stop you
from going too far?

1015
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,075
You said you believed in me,

1016
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:54,810
that this is
what I was born to do.

1017
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,879
And I don't wanna
stop you from that.

1018
00:56:57,979 --> 00:56:59,948
I... I don't
wanna stop you

1019
00:57:00,048 --> 00:57:01,850
from being whatever
you need to be.

1020
00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:04,686
I just don't want you dying...

1021
00:57:04,786 --> 00:57:08,923
trying to be everything
for everyone else, too.

1022
00:57:09,024 --> 00:57:10,125
Don't do this alone.

1023
00:57:10,225 --> 00:57:13,061
Let me help you, please.

1024
00:57:13,161 --> 00:57:14,963
I can't lose you, Elsa.

1025
00:57:17,899 --> 00:57:20,702
I can't lose you either, Anna.

1026
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:23,905
- Come on.
- Mmm.

1027
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:26,675
Wait, what?

1028
00:57:26,775 --> 00:57:28,209
What are you doing?

1029
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:29,678
Elsa!

1030
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,048
No! No!

1031
00:57:34,149 --> 00:57:35,384
Olaf, help me stop.

1032
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:37,052
Give me a hand.

1033
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,889
- Hang on!
- Whoa!

1034
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:43,425
Wait. Wait!
No! No! No!

1035
00:57:43,525 --> 00:57:45,427
Oh, come on!

1036
00:57:45,527 --> 00:57:47,763
Anna,
this might sound crazy...

1037
00:57:47,863 --> 00:57:50,032
but I'm sensing
some rising anger.

1038
00:57:50,132 --> 00:57:52,767
Well, I am angry, Olaf!

1039
00:57:52,868 --> 00:57:55,404
She promised me
we'd do this together!

1040
00:57:55,504 --> 00:57:57,139
Yeah. Uh-huh.

1041
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:01,076
But what I mean is,
I'm sensing rising anger in me.

1042
00:58:01,176 --> 00:58:03,111
Wait, you're angry?

1043
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:05,213
Um, I... I think so.

1044
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:07,182
Elsa pushed me away, too,

1045
00:58:07,282 --> 00:58:09,918
and didn't even say goodbye.

1046
00:58:10,018 --> 00:58:13,321
And you have every right
to be very, very mad at her.

1047
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:16,024
And you said some things
never change.

1048
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:16,958
But since then,

1049
00:58:17,058 --> 00:58:20,896
everything's done nothing
but change.

1050
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:22,431
I know.

1051
00:58:22,531 --> 00:58:26,068
But look, I'm still here
holding your hand.

1052
00:58:26,168 --> 00:58:29,070
Yeah,
that's a good point, Anna.

1053
00:58:29,171 --> 00:58:31,239
I feel better.
You're such a good listener.

1054
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:34,209
Don't shush me. That's rude.

1055
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:36,378
No! No!

1056
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:48,322
Oh. The Giants.

1057
00:58:48,423 --> 00:58:50,392
They're huge.

1058
00:59:06,474 --> 00:59:08,209
Hang on, Olaf.
Huh?

1059
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:15,217
Try not to scream.

1060
00:59:28,563 --> 00:59:29,931
Found it.

1061
00:59:31,399 --> 00:59:33,034
Thank you.

1062
00:59:33,134 --> 00:59:35,003
Where are we?

1063
00:59:35,103 --> 00:59:37,472
In a pit with no way out.

1064
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:41,175
But with a spooky,
pitch-black way in.

1065
00:59:47,282 --> 00:59:48,917
Come on, it'll be fun.

1066
00:59:49,017 --> 00:59:50,786
Assuming we don't
get stuck here forever,

1067
00:59:50,886 --> 00:59:51,920
no one ever finds us...

1068
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,022
and you starve and I give up.

1069
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:56,358
But, bright side,
Elsa's gotta be doing

1070
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:59,860
a whole lot
better than we are.

1071
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:38,033
Okay.

1072
01:00:48,409 --> 01:00:49,978
Oh.

1073
01:00:59,553 --> 01:01:00,922
Whoa!

1074
01:01:28,349 --> 01:01:29,450
No!

1075
01:01:46,634 --> 01:01:48,270
Whoa!

1076
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,360
No!

1077
01:02:40,254 --> 01:02:42,057
Of course.

1078

1153
01:07:40,955 --> 01:07:42,890
Iduna!

1154
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:44,492
What are you reading,
Your Majesty?

1155
01:07:44,592 --> 01:07:45,994
Oh, some new Danish author.

1156
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,937
King Runeard,
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1157
01:07:56,037 --> 01:07:57,338
Grandfather?

1158
01:07:57,438 --> 01:07:59,039
We bring Arendelle's full guard.

1159
01:07:59,140 --> 01:08:03,344
But they have given us no reason
not to trust them.

1160
01:08:03,444 --> 01:08:04,946
The Northuldra follow magic.

1161
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:06,914
Which means we can never trust them.

1162
01:08:07,014 --> 01:08:08,650
Grandfather?

1163
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:11,019
Magic makes people feel too powerful.
Too entitled.

1164
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,556
It makes them think
they can defy the will of a king.

1165
01:08:15,656 --> 01:08:17,692
That is not what magic does.

1166
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,393
That's just your fear.

1167
01:08:19,494 --> 01:08:21,629
Fear is what can't be trusted.

1168
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:31,005
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1169
01:08:31,104 --> 01:08:32,773
so they will have to turn to me.

1170
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:38,879
♪ Dive down deep into her sound

1171
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:43,750
♪ But not too far,
or you'll be drowned

1172
01:08:43,851 --> 01:08:46,086
They will come
in celebration.

1173
01:08:46,187 --> 01:08:49,757
And then, we will know
their size and strength.

1174
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:54,796
As you have welcomed us,
we welcome you...

1175
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:57,432
our neighbors, our friends.

1176
01:09:14,815 --> 01:09:17,951
King Runeard, the dam isn't
strengthening our waters.

1177
01:09:18,052 --> 01:09:19,586
It's hurting the Forest.

1178
01:09:19,687 --> 01:09:21,055
It's cutting off the North...

1179
01:09:21,155 --> 01:09:22,757
Let... Let's not
discuss this here.

1180
01:09:22,857 --> 01:09:25,993
Let's meet on the fjord.
Have tea.

1181
01:09:26,093 --> 01:09:27,795
Find a solution.

1182
01:09:39,139 --> 01:09:40,475
No!

1183
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:47,848
Anna!

1184
01:09:56,790 --> 01:10:01,662
Hmm. Which lucky tunnel
do we choose?

1185
01:10:01,762 --> 01:10:04,132
You see, the dam
will weaken their lands,

1186
01:10:04,232 --> 01:10:05,633
so they will have to turn to me.

1187
01:10:05,733 --> 01:10:07,211
King Runeard, the dam,

1188
01:10:07,235 --> 01:10:09,070
it's hurting the Forest.

1189
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:15,777
Elsa's found it.

1190
01:10:15,877 --> 01:10:17,078
What is it?

1191
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:19,147
The truth about the past.

1192
01:10:20,147 --> 01:10:22,417
That's my grandfather...

1193
01:10:22,517 --> 01:10:25,820
attacking
the Northuldra leader...

1194
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:28,589
who wields no weapon.

1195
01:10:31,158 --> 01:10:33,727
The dam wasn't a gift of peace.

1196
01:10:34,628 --> 01:10:36,431
It was a trick.

1197
01:10:36,531 --> 01:10:38,032
But that goes against everything

1198
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:40,067
Arendelle stands for.

1199
01:10:40,167 --> 01:10:41,736
It does, doesn't it?

1200
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:46,841
I know how to free the Forest.

1201
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:51,145
I know what we have to do
to set things right.

1202
01:10:51,245 --> 01:10:54,115
Why do you say that so sadly?

1203
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:55,850
We have to break the dam.

1204
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,653
But Arendelle will be flooded.

1205
01:10:58,753 --> 01:11:01,589
That's why everyone
was forced out.

1206
01:11:01,689 --> 01:11:04,926
To protect them
from what has to be done.

1207
01:11:05,026 --> 01:11:06,861
Oh. Oh!

1208
01:11:09,963 --> 01:11:11,566
Are you okay?

1209
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:14,502
I could really use
a bright side, Olaf.

1210
01:11:14,602 --> 01:11:16,737
Bright side? Um...

1211
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:19,507
Turtles can breathe
through their butts.

1212
01:11:19,607 --> 01:11:22,844
Huh?
And I see a way out.

1213
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:26,514
I knew I could count on you.

1214
01:11:30,818 --> 01:11:34,155
Come on, Olaf, Elsa's probably
on her way back right now.

1215
01:11:34,255 --> 01:11:35,723
We can meet her and...

1216
01:11:37,858 --> 01:11:38,860
Olaf?

1217
01:11:39,826 --> 01:11:41,195
What's this?

1218
01:11:41,295 --> 01:11:42,864
Are you okay?

1219
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:44,899
I'm flurrying?

1220
01:11:44,999 --> 01:11:46,033
Wait. No. That's...

1221
01:11:46,133 --> 01:11:47,835
That's not it.

1222
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:52,840
I'm flurrying away.

1223
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:56,110
The magic in me is fading.

1224
01:11:56,210 --> 01:11:57,545
What?

1225
01:11:59,313 --> 01:12:01,516
I don't think Elsa's okay.

1226
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:03,885
I think...

1227
01:12:04,785 --> 01:12:07,054
she may have gone too far.

1228
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:10,790
No. No.

1229
01:12:10,891 --> 01:12:12,192
Anna?

1230
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:14,161
I'm sorry.

1231
01:12:14,261 --> 01:12:17,665
You're gonna have to do
this next part on your own.

1232
01:12:17,765 --> 01:12:19,232
Okay?
Wait.

1233
01:12:19,333 --> 01:12:20,868
Come here.

1234
01:12:20,968 --> 01:12:23,838
I've got you.
Oh.

1235
01:12:23,938 --> 01:12:25,306
That's good.

1236
01:12:27,074 --> 01:12:28,875
Hey, Anna?

1237
01:12:28,976 --> 01:12:32,013
I just thought of one thing
that's permanent.

1238
01:12:32,113 --> 01:12:33,548
What's that?

1239
01:12:34,014 --> 01:12:35,750
Love.

1240
01:12:36,917 --> 01:12:38,919
Warm hugs?

1241
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,659
I like warm hugs.

1242
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:55,636
I love you.

1243
01:14:01,368 --> 01:14:04,071
Olaf? Elsa?

1244
01:14:05,706 --> 01:14:07,975

1245
01:14:11,845 --> 01:14:14,315

What?

1300
01:18:45,285 --> 01:18:47,922
No, no, no, no.
She's leading them to the dam.

Kristoff!

1302

I'm here.
What do you need?

1303
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,268

You got it.

1304
01:19:02,369 --> 01:19:03,369
Thank you.

1305
01:19:19,319 --> 01:19:21,155
Come on. Come on.

Lieutenant Mattias.

1308
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:31,332
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

1309
01:19:31,432 --> 01:19:32,433
The dam must fall.

1310
01:19:32,733 --> 01:19:35,336
It's the only way to break the mist
and free the Forest.

1311
01:19:35,436 --> 01:19:38,138
But we've sworn to protect
Arendelle at all costs.

1312
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:41,374
Arendelle has no future
until we make this right.

1313
01:19:41,475 --> 01:19:43,544
King Runeard betrayed everyone.

1314
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:46,280
How do you know that?

1315
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,083
My sister gave her life
for the truth.

1316
01:19:51,518 --> 01:19:52,753
Please.

1317
01:19:52,853 --> 01:19:55,055
Before we lose anyone else.

1318
01:20:17,277 --> 01:20:18,345
Look out!

1319
01:20:25,618 --> 01:20:27,620
Destroy the dam!
Come on!

1320
01:20:27,721 --> 01:20:29,323
Throw your boulders.

1321
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:35,562
That's it.

1322
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,182
I've got her!
Anna!

1323
01:20:55,282 --> 01:20:56,650
Hang on!

1324
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:18,559
I'm sorry I left you behind.

1325
01:23:18,659 --> 01:23:21,361
I was just so desperate
to protect her.

1326
01:23:21,461 --> 01:23:24,631
I know. I know.
It's okay.

1327
01:23:24,731 --> 01:23:26,433
My love is not fragile.

1328
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,436
Wow.

1329
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:32,372
Look at the sky.

1330
01:23:34,441 --> 01:23:36,743
I just didn't realize
there was so much of it.

1331
01:23:36,843 --> 01:23:38,779
34 years...

1332
01:23:38,879 --> 01:23:40,247
Five months...

1333
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:43,250
And 23 days.

1334
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,589
Is it really you?

1335
01:24:55,689 --> 01:24:57,790
Anna.

1336
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:01,628
I thought I'd lost you.

1337
01:25:01,728 --> 01:25:02,963
Lost me?

1338
01:25:03,063 --> 01:25:05,766
You saved me. Again.

1339
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:06,867
I did?

1340
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:09,870
And, Anna,
Arendelle did not fall.

1341
01:25:11,872 --> 01:25:13,307
It didn't?

1342
01:25:13,407 --> 01:25:15,509
The spirits all agreed.

1343
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:18,611
Arendelle deserves
to stand with you.

1344
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,048
Me?

1345
01:25:21,148 --> 01:25:24,051
You did what was right.
For everyone.

1346
01:25:24,151 --> 01:25:26,386
Did you find the fifth spirit?

1347
01:25:28,121 --> 01:25:31,358
You are
the fifth spirit.

1348
01:25:31,458 --> 01:25:32,625
You're the bridge.

1349
01:25:32,726 --> 01:25:35,462
Well, actually,
a bridge has two sides.

1350
01:25:35,562 --> 01:25:38,532
And Mother had two daughters.

1351
01:25:38,632 --> 01:25:40,701
We did this together.

1352
01:25:40,801 --> 01:25:43,704
And we'll continue
to do this together.

1353
01:25:44,637 --> 01:25:45,672
Together.

1354
01:25:45,772 --> 01:25:48,075
Elsa! You're okay!

1355
01:25:51,445 --> 01:25:52,779
You look different.

1356
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:54,157
Did you cut your hair
or something?

1357
01:25:54,181 --> 01:25:57,049
Or something.
Oh.

1358
01:26:00,453 --> 01:26:03,923
Anna, I need to ask you
a question.

1359
01:26:04,024 --> 01:26:05,624
Okay.

1360
01:26:05,725 --> 01:26:07,928
Do you want to build a snowman?

1361
01:26:08,661 --> 01:26:09,763
What?

1362
01:26:22,442 --> 01:26:25,879
Thank goodness water has memory.

1363
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:38,959
Anna.

1364
01:26:39,059 --> 01:26:41,561
Elsa!

1365
01:26:41,661 --> 01:26:43,864
Kristoff! And Sven!

1366
01:26:43,964 --> 01:26:46,967
You all came back.

1367
01:26:47,067 --> 01:26:50,437
Oh, I love happy endings.

1368
01:26:50,537 --> 01:26:51,838
I mean, I presume we're done.

1369
01:26:51,938 --> 01:26:54,508
Or is this "putting us
in mortal danger" situation

1370
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:56,076
gonna be a regular thing?

1371
01:26:56,176 --> 01:26:57,977
No. We're done.

1372
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:01,181
Actually,
there is one more thing.

1373
01:27:01,781 --> 01:27:03,116
Anna,

1374
01:27:03,216 --> 01:27:05,951
you are the most extraordinary person
I've ever known.

1375
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:09,990
I love you with all I am.

1376
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:11,658
Will you marry me?

1377
01:27:11,758 --> 01:27:13,126
Oh.

1378
01:27:13,226 --> 01:27:15,195
Yes!
Ah.

1379
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,639
Aw.

1380
01:27:40,186 --> 01:27:41,588
Arendelle's okay.

1381
01:27:41,688 --> 01:27:43,023
What?

1382
01:27:43,956 --> 01:27:45,625
Ahtohallan is beautiful.

1383
01:27:45,725 --> 01:27:47,026
Oh!

1384
01:27:47,127 --> 01:27:49,196
Hello.

1385
01:27:49,296 --> 01:27:52,865
You know, you belong up here.

1386
01:27:52,966 --> 01:27:56,902
I took an oath to always do
what's best for Arendelle.

1387
01:27:57,003 --> 01:28:00,774
Luckily,
I know just what that is.

1388
01:28:00,874 --> 01:28:03,610
While I still don't know
what "transformation" means...

1389
01:28:03,710 --> 01:28:07,948
I feel like this Forest
has really changed us all.

1390
01:28:12,752 --> 01:28:18,158
Presenting Her Majesty,
Queen Anna of Arendelle!

1391
01:28:24,196 --> 01:28:26,833
Oh! Hello.
Hi.

1392
01:28:26,933 --> 01:28:29,836
Sven, don't you look nice.

1393
01:28:31,071 --> 01:28:33,039
Oh, my goodness! Olaf!

1394
01:28:33,139 --> 01:28:35,041
Charmed, I'm sure.

1395
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:36,843
Charming.

1396
01:28:36,943 --> 01:28:38,645
Your Majesty.

1397
01:28:39,946 --> 01:28:41,848
Kristoff.

1398
01:28:41,948 --> 01:28:44,683
Aw, did you boys
get all dressed up for me?

1399
01:28:44,784 --> 01:28:46,853
It was Sven's idea.

1400
01:28:46,953 --> 01:28:49,990
One hour. You get this
for one hour.

1401
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,725
That's okay.

1402
01:28:51,825 --> 01:28:53,827
I prefer you in leather anyway.

1403
01:28:57,097 --> 01:28:59,699
I'm shocked you can last
an hour. That was brutal.

1404
01:28:59,799 --> 01:29:02,936
The things we do for love.

1405
01:29:03,036 --> 01:29:04,938
What is this crazy magic
called again?

1406
01:29:05,038 --> 01:29:06,272
A photograph.

1407
01:29:06,373 --> 01:29:08,275
Photograph. Huh.

1408
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,743
We look good.

1409
01:29:09,843 --> 01:29:11,611
Halima. General Mattias.

1410
01:29:11,711 --> 01:29:13,713
Uh, Your Majesty.
I'll be right back.

1411
01:29:13,813 --> 01:29:16,249
You can look at our photograph
while I'm gone.

1412
01:29:16,349 --> 01:29:18,285
I'm just kidding.

1413
01:29:18,385 --> 01:29:20,687
How am I doing?
Fantastic.

1414
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:33,700
Our lands and people,
now connected by love.

1415
01:29:39,705 --> 01:29:42,175
Hi, Gale.
You like it?

1416
01:29:42,275 --> 01:29:45,912
Oh, do you mind?
I've got a message for my sister.

1417
01:30:05,131 --> 01:30:07,133
Thank you.

1418
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:11,805
"Charades Friday night.
Don't be late.

Arendelle's doing just fine.

1421

I love you, too, sis.
