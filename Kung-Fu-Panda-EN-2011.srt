1
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:24,691
<i>Long ago, in ancient China,</i>

2
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:28,070
<i>the Peacocks ruled over Gongmen City.</i>

3
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,699
<i>They brought great joy and prosperity to the city...</i>

4
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,203
<i>for they had invented fireworks.</i>

5
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:42,334
<i>But their son, Lord Shen,</i>

6
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,921
<i>saw darker power in the fireworks.</i>

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,633
<i>What had brought colour and joy...</i>

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>could also bring darkness and destruction.</i>

9
00:00:54,346 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>Shen's troubled parents consulted a soothsayer.</i>

10
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:03,605
<i>She foretold that if Shen continued down this dark path,</i>

11
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>he would be defeated by a warrior of black and white.</i>

12
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:13,532
<i>The young lord set out to change his fate.</i>

13
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:18,537
<i>But what he did next only sealed it.</i>

14
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:27,421
<i>Shen returned to his parents full of pride.</i>

15
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,717
<i>But in their faces, he saw only horror.</i>

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,305
<i>He was banished from the city forever.</i>

17
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,683
<i>But Shen swore revenge.</i>

18
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,686
<i>Someday he would return...</i>

19
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:46,732
<i>and all of China would bow at his feet.</i>

20
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,099
It's almost done, Lord Shen, but we've run out of metal.

21
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:27,189
<i>Search the farthest villages! Find more metal!</i>

22
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:29,233
China will be mine.

23
00:02:39,368 --> 00:02:42,579
<i>And then the Dragon Warrior joined the Furious Five!</i>

24
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,624
And they became the most awesomest kung fu team ever!

25
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,626
Enough talk. Let's fight!

26
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,962
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

27
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,464
You can hear the Dragon Warrior training right now!

28
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,049
<i>- Thirty-three.
- Stop him!</i>

29
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:55,467
<i>- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!</i>

30
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:57,970
<i>- Thirty-five. Thirty-six!
- Stay focused.</i>

31
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,805
<i>- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!</i>

32
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,432
How is he doing that with his face?

33
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,772
Thirty-eight bean buns!

34
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,483
Yes! New record! You monster!

35
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,944
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

36
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,321
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

37
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,614
Do it.

38
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,199
No problem!

39
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:23,954
<i>Yeah!</i>

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,498
Give me a minute.

41
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,168
Yeah!

42
00:03:30,169 --> 00:03:32,379
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

43
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,382
Your training has paid off.

44
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,760
Master Shifu! Gotta go. See you later!

45
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,847
You'll save those for me, right?

46
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,690
Flippety-do.

47
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,911
Inner peace.

48
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,416
Inner peace.

49
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,505
Inner peace.

50
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,089
Master Shifu.

51
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,967
Master Shifu, what do we got?

52
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,054
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

53
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:26,266
Whatever it is, I will take them down. 'Cause I am in a mood.

54
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:28,852
I need to get something done, you know what I mean?

55
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,022
What are you doing?

56
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,609
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

57
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,891
Awesome!

58
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:10,978
How did you do that?

59
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:15,148
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

60
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,653
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

61
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,659
Every master must find his path to inner peace.

62
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:29,997
Some choose to meditate for 50 years in a cave just like this...

63
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,169
without the slightest taste of food or water.

64
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,005
Or?

65
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:41,633
Some find it through pain and suffering, as I did.

66
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,179
Po, the day you were chosen as Dragon Warrior...

67
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,181
was the worst day of my life.

68
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,601
By far. Nothing else came close.

69
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:55,147
It was the worst, most painful, mind-destroying, horrible moment...

70
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,774
- Okay.
- ...I have ever experienced.

71
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:05,866
But once I realised the problem was not you, but within me,

72
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:11,622
I found inner peace and was able to harness the flow of the universe.

73
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,333
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

74
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,627
My innards are already super, super peaceful,

75
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,214
so all I need to do is just get this thing going.

76
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,341
Inner peace, you're going down.

77
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,301
Now show me what you were doing there with your feet.

78
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:25,552
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

79
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,722
Po! Bandits! Approaching the Musicians Village.

80
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,973
Danger.

81
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,061
Tell those musicians to start playing some action music because it is on.

82
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,605
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master inner peace as soon as I get back.

83
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,398
No snack stops this time.

84
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,276
Snack stops.

85
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,153
Wait, are you serious?

86
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,793
Get all the metal you can find!

87
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:03,131
<i>Grab the metal!</i>

88
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,973
Help, help, help, help. Help!

89
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:16,436
That's everything! Let's get out of here.

90
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,730
Oh, no.

91
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:26,071
Wings of Justice!

92
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:46,258
The Dragon Warrior!

93
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,719
A panda? That's impossible.

94
00:07:48,886 --> 00:07:50,804
My fist hungers for justice.

95
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,682
That was my... fist.

96
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:56,185
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

97
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,751
Take that!

98
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,763
Po! Incoming!

99
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,765
Thanks, Mantis!

100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,035
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

101
00:09:03,836 --> 00:09:04,878
Feet of Fury!

102
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,718
Tigress! Monkey!

103
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,846
Viper! Mantis!

104
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,848
Bunny! What?

105
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,850
Oh, sorry.

106
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:24,940
Help!

107
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:28,026
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

108
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,755
Is everyone okay?

109
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:51,341
That was awesome!

110
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:55,137
I got this.

111
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,733
Po!

112
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,532
Chew on that, tubby!

113
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,040
Help.

114
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,461
- <i>Sweetie, are you okay?</i>
- What happened?

115
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,797
I think I saw...

116
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,300
I think...

117
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,885
I gotta go.

118
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:42,476
Thank you. Thank you for coming to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

119
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,394
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

120
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:47,314
If you need anything, just ask.

121
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,193
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

122
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,822
The Dragon Warrior's mop. He mopped these very floors!

123
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,326
No touching! You'll get the mop dirty.

124
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,828
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

125
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,916
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it. Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

126
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,418
He doesn't work here any more.

127
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:12,089
He's busy out there protecting the Valley.

128
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:13,757
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

129
00:11:13,924 --> 00:11:14,967
Po!

130
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:19,596
- Here. Okay. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

131
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:22,015
- Should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

132
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,434
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.

133
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:29,106
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

134
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:35,445
In honour of my son, free tofu dessert for everybody!

135
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,489
With purchases.

136
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:41,285
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

137
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,080
Have you lost weight? I can almost put my wings around you.

138
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,915
Ah, well, maybe a little.

139
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,919
Poor you, you must feel weak. Let me get you some soup.

140
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,671
No, that's okay, Dad. I'm not hungry.

141
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,507
Not hungry? Po, are you all right?

142
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:57,634
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

143
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,137
Earlier today, I was fighting these bandits.

144
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,557
Nothing too dangerous. I mean, they were just, you know...

145
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:06,685
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

146
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,562
I had this crazy vision.

147
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:12,524
I think I saw my mom and me, as a baby.

148
00:12:13,025 --> 00:12:15,319
Mom? A baby?

149
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,864
- Dad?
- What?

150
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,034
How do I say this?

151
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,537
Where did I come from?

152
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:35,214
Well, you see, son, baby geese come from a little egg.

153
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,052
- Don't ask where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

154
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,430
I know it's not.

155
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:48,894
I think it's time I told you something I should have told you a long time ago.

156
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:50,854
Okay.

157
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,858
You might have been kind of a...

158
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,030
adopted.

159
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,032
- I knew it.
- You knew?

160
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:05,160
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

161
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,163
But if you knew, why didn't you ever say anything?

162
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,207
Why didn't you say anything?

163
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:15,212
How did I get here, Dad? Where did I come from?

164
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:20,384
Actually... you came from this.

165
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:27,140
It was just another day at the restaurant.

166
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,934
Time to make the noodles.

167
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:34,231
<i>I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.</i>

168
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,109
<i>There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i>

169
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:40,904
<i>Only there were no radishes.</i>

170
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,491
<i>Just a very hungry baby panda.</i>

171
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,079
<i>There was no note.</i>

172
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,290
<i>Of course, you could have eaten it.</i>

173
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:56,461
<i>I waited for someone to come looking for you, but no one did.</i>

174
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:22,446
<i>I brought you inside.</i>

175
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,325
<i>Fed you.</i>

176
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:29,494
<i>Gave you a bath.</i>

177
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:34,499
<i>And fed you again.</i>

178
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,587
<i>And again.</i>

179
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,467
<i>And tried to put some pants on you.</i>

180
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:56,021
<i>And then I made a decision that would change my life forever.</i>

181
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:01,318
<i>To make my soup without radishes.</i>

182
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:05,739
<i>And to raise you as my own son.</i>

183
00:15:05,906 --> 00:15:10,118
<i>Xiao Po, my little panda.</i>

184
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:15,666
<i>And from that moment on, both my soup and my life...</i>

185
00:15:15,832 --> 00:15:18,001
have been that much sweeter.

186
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:22,172
And, little Po, that's the end of the story.

187
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,510
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

188
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:31,181
That's it? That can't be it. There's gotta be more, Dad!

189
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:35,561
Well, there was the time you ate all my bamboo furniture.

190
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:37,729
It was imported, too.

191
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:41,066
One dumpling, please, Dragon Warrior size.

192
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:50,284
Oh, Po, your story may not have such a happy beginning,

193
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,952
but look how it turned out.

194
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,873
You got me, you got kung fu, and you got noodles.

195
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:58,709
I know. I just have so many questions.

196
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:01,295
Like how did I ever fit in this tiny basket?

197
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,130
Why didn't I like pants?

198
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,467
And who am I?

199
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,560
<i>Good. Watch your form.</i>

200
00:16:19,271 --> 00:16:20,731
<i>Good.</i>

201
00:16:22,316 --> 00:16:25,110
<i>Better. Elbow.</i>

202
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:27,279
<i>Straighten it out!</i>

203
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,265
Shen?

204
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:58,393
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

205
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,315
Now we've got the pleasantries out of the way, please leave my house.

206
00:17:03,482 --> 00:17:05,609
- Your house?
- <i>Yes.</i>

207
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,278
Didn't you see the peacock on the front door?

208
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:12,407
There you are, Soothsayer.

209
00:17:12,991 --> 00:17:17,746
It seems your fortune-telling skills are not as good as you thought.

210
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:21,917
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

211
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,628
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

212
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:29,299
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

213
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:32,135
Gongmen is under the stewardship of the Masters' Council,

214
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:36,139
and we will protect it. Even from you.

215
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,561
I'm so glad you feel that way.

216
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,564
Otherwise, I'd have dragged that here for nothing.

217
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,774
What's in the box, Shen?

218
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:49,486
You want to see? It's a gift.

219
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:53,448
It's your parting gift, in that it will part you.

220
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,158
Part of you here, part of you there...

221
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:59,288
and part of you way over there, staining the wall!

222
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,456
You insolent fool!

223
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:21,977
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

224
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:24,980
You are no match for our kung fu.

225
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,107
I agree.

226
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,984
But this is.

227
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:45,709
Are you familiar with the master of Gongmen City?

228
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:47,211
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

229
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,963
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

230
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,091
And slayer of the Ten Thousand Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

231
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,302
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

232
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,678
That's impossible.

233
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,306
Rhino's Horn Defence is impervious to any technique.

234
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:02,976
It was no technique. Lord Shen has created a weapon,

235
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:05,562
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

236
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:11,068
Unless he is stopped, this could be the end of kung fu.

237
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:15,614
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

238
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:19,701
Go! Destroy this weapon and bring Lord Shen to justice!

239
00:19:19,868 --> 00:19:21,703
Okay, here we go! Here we go!

240
00:19:22,955 --> 00:19:25,582
Wait a second. How can I do this?

241
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:28,377
I mean, how can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?

242
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,462
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

243
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:34,007
anything is possible when you have inner peace.

244
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:42,432
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

245
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,351
Peace on.

246
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,562
- <i>Oh, Po?</i>
- Peace!

247
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:48,856
<i>Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.</i>

248
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:52,109
I packed you food for weeks. Cookies, buns, vegetables.

249
00:19:52,276 --> 00:19:55,529
And I even packed all your action figures. See?

250
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:01,910
I don't know what those are. Never seen them before in my life.

251
00:20:02,077 --> 00:20:03,954
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

252
00:20:04,121 --> 00:20:06,999
I also packed your paintings of our best time together,

253
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:09,710
just in case you get lonely.

254
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,714
That's me and you making noodles. And that's me and you eating noodles.

255
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,300
And that's me giving you a piggyback ride.

256
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,721
That cute? On second thought, I'll hang on to this one.

257
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:24,766
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

258
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,103
You have a job to do... far from home,

259
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,982
in a strange city, filled with strange people, and strange noodles,

260
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:35,903
facing horrible danger from which you might never return!

261
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:38,655
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

262
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:42,117
I'm the Dragon Warrior. It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

263
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:45,245
And if I don't... what am I?

264
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:47,873
You're my son.

265
00:20:50,542 --> 00:20:51,668
Right?

266
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:56,089
- <i>Po, it's time.</i>
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,593
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

268
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,137
He'll be back before you can say "Noodles".

269
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,853
Noodles.

270
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:18,111
Come on, guys, let's go!

271
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,488
Yeah!

272
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:23,867
Yeah...

273
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,787
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

274
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,618
Mama?

275
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,918
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

276
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,420
Mom! Dad!

277
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,674
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

278
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,136
Honey, what are you doing here?

279
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,346
But I thought...

280
00:23:07,513 --> 00:23:10,432
We replaced you, dear, with this lovely radish.

281
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:14,645
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

282
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:16,688
does better kung fu.

283
00:23:17,356 --> 00:23:19,066
No. No, no, no.

284
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:24,154
Wait!

285
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:31,411
<i>No.</i>

286
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,631
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

287
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:53,016
Inner pea...

288
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:56,895
Pea...

289
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,941
Inner peace.

290
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:22,129
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!

291
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,053
I'm... training.

292
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,514
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

293
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,562
- I am ready.
- Okay.

294
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,731
So serious.

295
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:50,532
I think I prefer the mast.

296
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:55,412
Apologies. I used to punch the ironwood trees by the palace to train.

297
00:24:55,579 --> 00:24:56,914
Now I feel nothing.

298
00:24:57,915 --> 00:24:59,958
That's severely cool.

299
00:25:02,878 --> 00:25:03,921
Again!

300
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:10,844
So, this punching ironwood trees, how long did you have to do that?

301
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,764
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

302
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,934
Is there any, you know, faster way?

303
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,811
You know, until you, you know, don't feel anything?

304
00:25:19,978 --> 00:25:21,939
No. Besides,

305
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:28,946
I don't think hard style is your thing.

306
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,078
Po, why are you really out here?

307
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:40,791
I just found out that my dad isn't really my dad.

308
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:44,670
Your dad? The goose.

309
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:49,550
That must have been quite a shock.

310
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,093
Yeah.

311
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,638
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

312
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:57,808
We're warriors, right? Nerves of steel.

313
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,935
Souls of platinum.

314
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,311
Like you.

315
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:03,438
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

316
00:26:07,943 --> 00:26:09,987
- I was...
- <i>So, what are you guys talking about?</i>

317
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:12,656
Nothing. Nothing.

318
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:14,950
Po's having daddy issues.

319
00:26:15,117 --> 00:26:18,245
I'm so lucky. I don't have any problems with my dad.

320
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,789
Maybe it's because Mom ate his head before I was born.

321
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:23,792
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

322
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:26,003
Po is the one freaking out.

323
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,338
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

324
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:30,716
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

325
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:33,552
- What?
- We're here.

326
00:26:33,719 --> 00:26:35,679
<i>Gongmen City.</i>

327
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,573
<i>My father's throne.</i>

328
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,784
He used to let me play here beside him,

329
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:02,456
promising someday, this throne would be mine.

330
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,587
A little to the left.

331
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,881
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

332
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:14,343
Thirty years I've waited for this moment.

333
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,013
Everything must be exactly how I envisioned it.

334
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,892
And I envisioned it a little to the left.

335
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,102
Perfect!

336
00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:27,481
With the weapon by my si... A little bit more.

337
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:35,405
With the weapon by my side, all of China will bow before me.

338
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,241
We move out in three days...

339
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:41,245
when the moon is full and the tide is high.

340
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,041
Now, you old goat, why don't you tell me my...

341
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,251
Fortune?

342
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:51,129
Future. I was going to say future.

343
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,676
Look into your bowl and tell me what glory awaits.

344
00:27:57,386 --> 00:28:00,931
If you continue on your current path,

345
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:07,271
you will find yourself at the bottom of the stairs.

346
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:11,775
I see...

347
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,570
I see...

348
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,782
I see pain... and anger.

349
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,952
How dare you! That is the finest silk in the province!

350
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,161
Followed by denial.

351
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,956
This is not fortune-telling. You're just saying...

352
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,125
- what's happening right...
- Now?

353
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,462
The most important time is now.

354
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,133
But if you really want to see the future...

355
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:40,679
Oh, what do you see?

356
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:48,437
<i>A peacock...</i>

357
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:53,817
<i>is defeated by a warrior of black and white.</i>

358
00:28:55,027 --> 00:28:57,029
<i>Nothing has changed.</i>

359
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:06,121
That's impossible, and you know it.

360
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:09,499
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

361
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,959
Who?

362
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,129
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

363
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,675
A kung fu warrior. It fought like a demon!

364
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,469
Big and furry.

365
00:29:20,636 --> 00:29:23,805
Soft and squishy. Kind of plush and cuddly.

366
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:27,601
There are no more pandas.

367
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:31,104
Even with his poor eyesight, he can see the truth.

368
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:34,149
Why is it that you cannot?

369
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:38,195
Find this panda and bring him to me!

370
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,113
Yes, sir!

371
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,117
One panda lives. That does not make you right.

372
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:48,121
You're right. Being right makes me right.

373
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:52,668
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

374
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,672
Will you stop that?

375
00:30:08,851 --> 00:30:11,937
That must be Shen's palace on the other side of the city.

376
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,648
Great. We'll march into the tower and proclaim,

377
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:16,859
"We are the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five,

378
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:19,027
and we are here to bring you to justice.".

379
00:30:22,281 --> 00:30:25,117
What are you doing? This place is crawling with wolves.

380
00:30:30,706 --> 00:30:33,208
Hey, isn't that the guy who hammered you in the face?

381
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,255
I do not like that guy.

382
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:42,050
We need to get to that tower without being spotted by those wolves.

383
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,720
Got it. Stealth mode.

384
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,370
<i>- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.</i>

385
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:14,208
<i>Now, where'd those noodles go?</i>

386
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:22,549
Hello. I couldn't help but...

387
00:31:23,342 --> 00:31:25,636
Yeah, okay. Anyway, where was I?

388
00:31:26,595 --> 00:31:28,805
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

389
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:33,727
Okay.

390
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:42,236
Guys! Guys?

391
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,112
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

392
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:45,781
So that was stealth mode, huh?

393
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:48,408
To be honest, not one of my stronger modes.

394
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:50,994
...gold in there, come on!

395
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:53,622
<i>This rice is raw!</i>

396
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:56,333
You stole all my metal pots for Lord Shen!

397
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,670
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

398
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:02,589
- <i>My apologies, but...</i>
- Po, do something.

399
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:05,259
How am I supposed to help her cook rice without getting caught?

400
00:32:05,425 --> 00:32:07,469
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- <i>...two,</i>

401
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:08,846
one.

402
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,639
- Hey.
- Hey.

403
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,361
We're here to liberate the city and bring Shen to justice.

404
00:32:24,528 --> 00:32:26,238
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

405
00:32:26,405 --> 00:32:27,865
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

406
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:31,201
Oh, no, not me. It's not safe to speak here.

407
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,828
Right.

408
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,708
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

409
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,253
They're in Gongmen Jail on Black Dragon Alley.

410
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,046
What? They're still alive?

411
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,215
They must be in that jail gathering intelligence,

412
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,093
hatching a plot to use their awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

413
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,928
Okay, let's go!

414
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,182
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

415
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,641
<i>- Hold it right there!
- Get them!</i>

416
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:57,060
<i>- Get them!
- Sorry!</i>

417
00:32:57,895 --> 00:32:59,396
<i>Take that!</i>

418
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:01,148
- Keep going!
- Faster!

419
00:33:02,191 --> 00:33:03,233
<i>Hey, stop!</i>

420
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,422
<i>- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!</i>

421
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,673
<i>Surround him.</i>

422
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,594
Now!

423
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,513
Gotcha!

424
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:34,806
What? Where'd he go?

425
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,768
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- <i>What about over there?</i>

426
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:41,897
<i>- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I...I guess.</i>

427
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:43,524
<i>Then search there!</i>

428
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,949
They must be close. I can feel a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

429
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,117
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

430
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:57,287
Look. Gongmen Jail.

431
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,709
Aw, it's cute.

432
00:34:03,794 --> 00:34:05,170
Cute, huh?

433
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,014
Nice work, Po.

434
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:20,102
At the first sign of trouble, I'll give you a signal.

435
00:34:21,645 --> 00:34:23,438
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

436
00:34:23,605 --> 00:34:25,983
Excuse me, when have I ever made that noise?

437
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,111
Master Ox! Master!

438
00:34:31,405 --> 00:34:32,823
The ferocious Master Croc!

439
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,160
And Master Storming Ox.

440
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,998
I can't believe we're rescuing actual legends of kung fu.

441
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:43,166
We're gonna free you from those bonds of injustice. No problem.

442
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,961
Gotta be a key around here. No, they wouldn't leave a key around here.

443
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,215
Oh, good! You found it. Come on, you guys! Yeah!

444
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:52,384
We're coming for you, Shen!

445
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,101
Guys, are we going or not? Do you want to meet us there later?

446
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:03,020
I mean, you do want to take back your city, right?

447
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:04,897
Of course we do.

448
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:08,901
But if we stand up to Shen, he will turn the weapon on the city.

449
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,861
Listen to yourself. You're protecting Gongmen City...

450
00:35:11,028 --> 00:35:12,821
by not protecting Gongmen City?

451
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:17,618
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

452
00:35:17,784 --> 00:35:21,538
Oh, would it? Then we use... a sneak attack!

453
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:24,291
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

454
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:29,046
by the unstoppable weapon.

455
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,548
Nothing's unstoppable except for me when I'm stopping you...

456
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,218
from telling me something's unstoppable!

457
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,439
Master Ox, I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

458
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,483
I'd like to see you get me out!

459
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:57,449
You guys see that? It's called being awesome.

460
00:35:57,616 --> 00:35:59,493
Come on! Whatever happened to being heroes?

461
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,412
The only hero in this town is a dead one!

462
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,712
Like I said, you are not getting me out of this cell!

463
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,175
Yes!

464
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,344
All right, let's go!

465
00:36:18,178 --> 00:36:19,429
I get the top bunk.

466
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:25,769
It's time to surrender, panda. Kung fu is dead.

467
00:36:25,936 --> 00:36:27,437
I...

468
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:31,650
You...

469
00:36:31,817 --> 00:36:34,987
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

470
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:38,615
You stay in your prison of fear with bars made of hopelessness.

471
00:36:38,782 --> 00:36:41,994
And all you get are three square meals a day of shame!

472
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,787
With despair for dessert.

473
00:36:43,954 --> 00:36:47,124
We'll take on Shen and prove to all those who are hungry...

474
00:36:47,291 --> 00:36:51,211
for justice and honour that kung fu still lives!

475
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:52,754
Yeah!

476
00:36:55,883 --> 00:36:57,009
Monkey?

477
00:36:58,552 --> 00:36:59,887
You! You're mine!

478
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,014
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

479
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:05,100
My fist in your plush, cuddly, super-soft face!

480
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:09,146
Get him!

481
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,398
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

482
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,609
<i>Stop him!</i>

483
00:37:16,612 --> 00:37:17,905
Faster!

484
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:23,493
Yeah! Go, go!

485
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,163
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

486
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:30,167
- Viper!
- Hang on!

487
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,346
- What?
- Watch out!

488
00:37:44,932 --> 00:37:47,017
Uncool! Very uncool!

489
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,102
Try this!

490
00:37:50,354 --> 00:37:51,522
Guys, guys, guys!

491
00:37:56,777 --> 00:37:58,362
Maybe something smaller!

492
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:01,031
No, no! Oh, no, no.

493
00:38:05,577 --> 00:38:08,330
<i>- Cute bunnies, off the face. Okay, pardon me!
- Excuse me!</i>

494
00:38:17,965 --> 00:38:19,675
Fire!

495
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:21,885
We've lost them.

496
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,855
- Again!
- Again!

497
00:38:33,981 --> 00:38:35,232
Crane, catch!

498
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:39,736
Gotcha!

499
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,039
Guys, guys, guys, guys, give me a shove!

500
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,750
Mantis, now!

501
00:39:07,181 --> 00:39:11,018
Is that all you got? It feels like I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

502
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,437
Well, this cloud is about to bring the thunder!

503
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:17,774
Your turn!

504
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:23,447
Why... are... there... so... many... signs?

505
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,590
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

506
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:46,261
Yes! Taste the defeat!

507
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:47,804
Let me tell you something.

508
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:50,974
Next time you mess with a panda, you better bring a whole a...

509
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:02,569
Guess nobody told you,

510
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:05,656
if you mess with the wolf, you get the fangs.

511
00:40:06,156 --> 00:40:10,035
I've hit you twice. What are you going to do now?

512
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,873
We surrender!

513
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:22,631
You can chain my body, but you will never chain my... warrior spirit.

514
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:25,300
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call?

515
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,637
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

516
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,183
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

517
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:36,603
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung. The more you move, the tighter they get.

518
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:39,523
These are the best cuffs!

519
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,695
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

520
00:40:46,071 --> 00:40:47,906
No, no, no...

521
00:40:51,201 --> 00:40:55,205
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

522
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:57,875
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

523
00:40:59,376 --> 00:41:03,130
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

524
00:41:03,297 --> 00:41:06,049
He is coming to me in chains.

525
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:08,719
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

526
00:41:11,972 --> 00:41:14,224
Don't even think about it.

527
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,324
I hope this turns out better than your plan to cook rice in your stomach...

528
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,826
by eating it raw and then drinking boiling water.

529
00:41:32,993 --> 00:41:35,078
This plan's nothing like that plan.

530
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:37,372
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

531
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:51,929
Keep moving.

532
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,187
Ah, my old enemy,

533
00:42:04,691 --> 00:42:06,777
stairs.

534
00:42:35,097 --> 00:42:38,308
Thanks for carrying me those last few flights. Okay.

535
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,894
I threw up a little bit on the third floor.

536
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:42,479
Someone might want to clean that up.

537
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:45,315
Is there some sort of evil janitor or something?

538
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,067
Greetings, panda.

539
00:42:47,234 --> 00:42:49,570
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

540
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,698
Hey.

541
00:42:52,865 --> 00:42:55,868
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

542
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,745
Hey... enough with the poking around.

543
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,665
Strong. Healthy.

544
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,501
Look, I don't know who you are, but please stand aside, sir.

545
00:43:04,668 --> 00:43:07,129
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

546
00:43:07,296 --> 00:43:10,007
The beard threw me. It's kind of misleading.

547
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:13,260
- <i>False advertising.</i>
- Enough of this nonsense!

548
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,095
Bring the prisoners to me.

549
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,889
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

550
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,600
Keep your eyes peeled for the... weapon!

551
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:25,230
Sparrow kick!

552
00:43:27,274 --> 00:43:30,444
<i>We did it! I just kung fu-ed it! Did you guys see that? I was all like...</i>

553
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,873
Do you actually believe this is the warrior destined to defeat me?

554
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,210
I do not. I know he is.

555
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:50,964
Oh, look at him. A lifetime to plot his revenge...

556
00:43:51,131 --> 00:43:54,635
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

557
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:56,053
I did not have a lifetime.

558
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,180
We only heard about Master Rhino a few days ago,

559
00:43:58,347 --> 00:44:03,060
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

560
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:05,729
Well, yeah. All the pots and pans that you stole.

561
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,315
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

562
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:11,068
You probably did some other evil stuff along the way. I don't know.

563
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,362
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

564
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:15,781
Know what? What's so funny?

565
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:19,076
The very thing that you clearly do not know!

566
00:44:19,243 --> 00:44:23,163
Okay, enough of these riddles! Would you guys spill the beans?

567
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,667
First, we come in and the weapon is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

568
00:44:26,834 --> 00:44:29,837
And then the lady over here, I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

569
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,715
The only reason you are still alive...

570
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:38,679
is that I find your stupidity mildly amusing.

571
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:42,182
Well, thank you. But I find your evilness extremely annoying.

572
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,226
Who do you think you are, panda?

573
00:44:44,393 --> 00:44:47,104
Who do you think I am, peacock?

574
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:57,865
Why are we laughing?

575
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,075
Take aim.

576
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,172
Fire.

577
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,012
Well, light the... thing!

578
00:45:20,179 --> 00:45:21,805
I did!

579
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,437
Fear the bug!

580
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:38,947
Get the weapon!

581
00:45:40,949 --> 00:45:42,826
Tigress!

582
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:17,069
You...You were there.

583
00:46:17,236 --> 00:46:20,197
Yes. Yes, I was.

584
00:46:28,038 --> 00:46:31,208
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

585
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,256
Fire!

586
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:42,052
Oh. No, he's got way more.

587
00:46:48,392 --> 00:46:49,768
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

588
00:46:49,935 --> 00:46:51,353
Coming!

589
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:54,648
- Watch out!
- Po!

590
00:46:57,943 --> 00:47:00,821
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

591
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,531
<i>Use the ropes.</i>

592
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:13,500
Run, run, little panda!

593
00:47:24,761 --> 00:47:27,848
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

594
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,641
Bring it down!

595
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:35,397
- We're trapped!
- This way!

596
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,278
Goodbye!

597
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:45,657
Fire!

598
00:47:47,117 --> 00:47:48,535
Get back!

599
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,587
The only way out is up.

600
00:47:59,296 --> 00:48:00,714
What?

601
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:14,186
Follow me! Come on!

602
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:16,104
Where are they going?

603
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:19,107
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

604
00:48:26,365 --> 00:48:27,908
Here we go!

605
00:48:46,593 --> 00:48:49,930
- You idiot!
- My nose!

606
00:48:50,097 --> 00:48:54,518
Call in the wolves! All of them! I want them ready to move!

607
00:48:54,685 --> 00:48:58,313
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

608
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,358
Right now? 'Cause it's the middle of the year,

609
00:49:01,525 --> 00:49:04,194
so you'd only get like a half of the Year of the Peacock.

610
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:09,116
And this is the Year, of course, of the Peacock.

611
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,285
Happy New Year, sir.

612
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:19,376
Get the wolves ready. We're loading the ships now.

613
00:49:19,543 --> 00:49:20,627
Now!

614
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:22,713
Now, now, now, now, now!

615
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,674
Move! Move, move, move, move!

616
00:49:42,065 --> 00:49:43,692
This way.

617
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,907
Let's go.

618
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:56,163
<i>Oh, you!</i>

619
00:49:56,496 --> 00:49:58,582
What did you do? It's chaos up there.

620
00:49:58,749 --> 00:50:00,417
What happened to stopping Shen?

621
00:50:01,877 --> 00:50:03,504
Yeah.

622
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:07,090
Guys, come on. Give me a little credit.

623
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:09,384
I meant for him to get away.

624
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:12,513
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

625
00:50:12,679 --> 00:50:17,601
I was thinking... I'll figure out his plot more.

626
00:50:18,268 --> 00:50:20,270
That makes no sense.

627
00:50:20,437 --> 00:50:22,105
What do you mean? Sure it does.

628
00:50:22,272 --> 00:50:25,609
Po, the truth. You had Shen. What happened?

629
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:27,819
What are you talking about? I don't know what you're talking about.

630
00:50:27,986 --> 00:50:30,531
I... Yeah... Okay, he caught me off guard.

631
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,491
The truth.

632
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:39,623
Fine. They will keep you far from danger.

633
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,334
- Real far.
- What?

634
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,628
You're staying here.

635
00:50:45,128 --> 00:50:47,548
Wait! I have to go ba...

636
00:50:52,928 --> 00:50:54,763
You're staying here!

637
00:50:55,305 --> 00:50:57,474
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

638
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,021
Okay. I wasn't ready that time.

639
00:51:03,188 --> 00:51:04,898
Guys? Don't.

640
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:06,149
Ready.

641
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:07,818
Look!

642
00:51:20,372 --> 00:51:21,748
Stay down.

643
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:26,461
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

644
00:51:28,839 --> 00:51:31,175
He was there! Okay?

645
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:34,553
The peacock was there the last time I saw my parents.

646
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,348
He knows what happened. Where I came from.

647
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,976
Who I am.

648
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,648
Look, I'm going.

649
00:51:47,274 --> 00:51:49,693
I have to know.

650
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,904
The hard core can't understand.

651
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,780
Tigress, no!

652
00:51:57,951 --> 00:51:59,953
The hard core do understand.

653
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,291
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

654
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:09,796
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

655
00:52:09,963 --> 00:52:12,883
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

656
00:52:14,551 --> 00:52:16,720
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

657
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:18,680
You're better off here.

658
00:52:28,232 --> 00:52:32,736
You were wrong, Soothsayer. We sail to victory tonight.

659
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,906
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

660
00:52:36,073 --> 00:52:39,034
Are you certain it is the panda who is a fool?

661
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,578
You just destroyed your ancestral home, Shen.

662
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:47,084
A trivial sacrifice... when all of China is my reward.

663
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,711
Then will you finally be satisfied?

664
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:54,091
Will the subjugation of the whole world finally make you feel better?

665
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:58,637
It's a start. I might also convert the basement into a dungeon.

666
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:04,268
The cup you choose to fill has no bottom.

667
00:53:04,434 --> 00:53:07,437
It is time to stop this madness.

668
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,399
Why on earth would I do that?

669
00:53:10,566 --> 00:53:12,776
So your parents can rest in peace.

670
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,572
My parents hated me.

671
00:53:17,781 --> 00:53:20,659
Do you understand?

672
00:53:20,826 --> 00:53:26,206
They wronged me... and I will make it right.

673
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:27,666
They loved you.

674
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:32,588
They loved you so much that having to send you away killed them.

675
00:53:35,174 --> 00:53:40,971
The dead exist in the past... and I must tend to the future.

676
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:49,855
Set the soothsayer free. She's no use to me.

677
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:53,650
Goodbye, Shen. I wish you happiness.

678
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,528
Happiness must be taken.

679
00:53:58,155 --> 00:54:00,532
And I will take mine.

680
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,182
- Hurry it up!
- <i>Move it!</i>

681
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:29,436
If all of those weapons leave the building, China will fall.

682
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:33,899
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

683
00:54:36,527 --> 00:54:38,695
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

684
00:54:38,862 --> 00:54:40,364
I can't feel my face.

685
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,799
Did you hear him call it "Year of the Peacock"?

686
00:54:58,966 --> 00:55:01,218
- Hey.
- Hey.

687
00:55:01,385 --> 00:55:02,928
Okay. So, keep it cool. Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

688
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,514
<i>You! Where are you going?</i>

689
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,061
On your feet! And wipe those stupid grins off your faces.

690
00:55:24,491 --> 00:55:28,287
<i>Move, you dogs! Faster, faster! Load them all!</i>

691
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:40,591
<i>Greetings, panda.</i>

692
00:55:44,178 --> 00:55:47,181
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

693
00:55:47,347 --> 00:55:50,350
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

694
00:55:50,517 --> 00:55:53,520
Yes! We're talking about the same night, right?

695
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:58,233
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched as your parents abandoned you.

696
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,988
It's a terrible thing. I believe it went something like this.

697
00:56:13,123 --> 00:56:14,583
Here's your New Year's gift.

698
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:16,919
Hope you like it, 'cause you can't return it.

699
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,173
Po? What's he doing here?

700
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:23,342
Return it! Return it!

701
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:37,940
Are you willing to die to find the truth?

702
00:56:38,106 --> 00:56:41,693
You bet I am. Although I'd prefer not to.

703
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,176
We got them. Go!

704
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:29,408
<i>You looking for me?</i>

705
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:38,208
I said that too soon, didn't I?

706
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:47,801
Po!

707
00:57:52,556 --> 00:57:54,099
Po, get away from him.

708
00:57:54,266 --> 00:57:56,226
I'll get up. Here we go.

709
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:01,690
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

710
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,859
Now... answers.

711
00:58:04,026 --> 00:58:06,778
Oh, you want to know so badly.

712
00:58:07,404 --> 00:58:10,616
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

713
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:14,828
Fill some crater in your soul?

714
00:58:14,995 --> 00:58:17,164
<i>Well, here's your answer.</i>

715
00:58:17,331 --> 00:58:20,417
Your parents didn't love you.

716
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:23,337
<i>But here...</i>

717
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:26,173
let me heal you!

718
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,972
No!

719
00:59:48,547 --> 00:59:51,049
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

720
00:59:55,304 --> 00:59:59,558
If I wanted you dead, I would have left you in that river.

721
00:59:59,725 --> 01:00:03,687
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfil your destiny.

722
01:00:03,854 --> 01:00:07,065
What are you talking about? Where am I?

723
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:10,903
What is this place?

724
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:15,073
I'm surprised you remember so little.

725
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,702
But you were so little when it happened.

726
01:00:23,999 --> 01:00:26,543
<i>Perhaps you do remember.</i>

727
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,712
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

728
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:30,964
Nightmare? Or memory?

729
01:01:01,912 --> 01:01:04,540
<i>This was a thriving village.</i>

730
01:01:04,706 --> 01:01:08,252
Young Shen was in line to rule Gongmen City.

731
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:10,254
But he wanted more.

732
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:16,176
I foretold that someone would stand in his way. A panda.

733
01:01:16,343 --> 01:01:20,305
But I never could have foretold what came next.

734
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,903
Get them all!

735
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:44,955
Take our son and run away! Go!

736
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:02,139
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

737
01:04:06,054 --> 01:04:10,142
Your story may not have such a happy beginning,

738
01:04:10,309 --> 01:04:13,437
but that doesn't make you who you are.

739
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:16,148
It is the rest of your story.

740
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:19,151
<i>Who you choose to be.</i>

741
01:04:51,308 --> 01:04:54,686
So, who are you, panda?

742
01:05:02,945 --> 01:05:04,363
I am Po.

743
01:05:06,156 --> 01:05:08,116
And I'm gonna need a hat.

744
01:05:17,543 --> 01:05:20,504
Such sad, sad faces.

745
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:23,382
But now is a time only for joy.

746
01:05:23,549 --> 01:05:27,594
You are going to be part of something beautiful.

747
01:05:29,847 --> 01:05:33,851
Once we reach the harbour, in front of all the world,

748
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:38,188
you and your precious kung fu will die.

749
01:05:40,357 --> 01:05:45,279
Then China will know to bow before me.

750
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:47,114
Set sail!

751
01:05:58,375 --> 01:05:59,793
What is that?

752
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,442
Honestly, guys, I never thought I'd die like this.

753
01:06:23,609 --> 01:06:26,612
I always thought I'd meet a nice girl and settle down and...

754
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:28,530
then she'd eat my head.

755
01:06:28,697 --> 01:06:31,116
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

756
01:06:31,283 --> 01:06:35,829
Po would want us to remain strong. Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

757
01:06:43,795 --> 01:06:47,758
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

758
01:06:48,467 --> 01:06:49,676
<i>Fire!</i>

759
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:00,771
You coward!

760
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:11,782
Po?

761
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:15,244
Po?

762
01:07:17,329 --> 01:07:22,459
How many times do I have to kill the same stinking panda?

763
01:07:32,052 --> 01:07:33,470
Shen!

764
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:37,683
A panda stands between you and your destiny.

765
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:39,434
What?

766
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:43,605
Prepare yourself for a hot serving of justice.

767
01:07:43,772 --> 01:07:45,440
<i>Your reign of terror comes to an end.</i>

768
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:48,861
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

769
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:51,113
Disc of Destruction!

770
01:08:02,207 --> 01:08:05,127
Okay. Take aim!

771
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:18,056
Ready?

772
01:08:38,994 --> 01:08:40,954
You can't follow me.

773
01:08:41,121 --> 01:08:42,206
Just get him!

774
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,254
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

775
01:08:56,512 --> 01:08:57,888
<i>- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!</i>

776
01:08:58,055 --> 01:08:59,097
No, don't shoot!

777
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:01,683
<i>- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!</i>

778
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,269
<i>- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.</i>

779
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:07,689
Yeah!

780
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:10,734
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

781
01:09:16,907 --> 01:09:19,368
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

782
01:09:24,706 --> 01:09:26,917
Impressive, Dragon Warrior. What's your plan?

783
01:09:27,084 --> 01:09:29,253
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

784
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:31,171
Honestly, I didn't think I'd make it this far.

785
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:32,381
Po!

786
01:09:32,548 --> 01:09:34,675
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

787
01:09:40,222 --> 01:09:41,265
Nice!

788
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,185
Viper, Puppet of Death!

789
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:46,937
Tigress!

790
01:09:55,612 --> 01:09:57,614
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

791
01:09:57,781 --> 01:10:00,284
- <i>And Croc!</i>
- Vengeance is served.

792
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:03,287
- Why did you?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

793
01:10:10,919 --> 01:10:12,129
Master Shifu!

794
01:10:14,464 --> 01:10:16,800
Quickly. Use their boats to block the way.

795
01:10:27,603 --> 01:10:28,645
Crane!

796
01:10:29,605 --> 01:10:31,523
Wings of Justice!

797
01:10:33,609 --> 01:10:34,818
Yeah!

798
01:10:40,949 --> 01:10:41,992
What?

799
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:56,089
I love you guys.

800
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,683
Why aren't we firing?

801
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:10,270
They're taking out our gunners, sir. They're getting close.

802
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:15,025
Fire! Fire at them!

803
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:19,279
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

804
01:11:19,446 --> 01:11:20,489
Fire!

805
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:24,159
No.

806
01:11:31,792 --> 01:11:33,085
Po!

807
01:12:08,662 --> 01:12:09,788
Tigress?

808
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,340
As you wish.

809
01:13:01,507 --> 01:13:03,133
Let's finish this.

810
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:28,033
Fire!

811
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,915
<i>Inner peace.</i>

812
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,402
Again!

813
01:14:10,701 --> 01:14:11,743
Yeah!

814
01:14:13,036 --> 01:14:15,998
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

815
01:14:38,187 --> 01:14:40,606
What? No. No!

816
01:14:47,237 --> 01:14:50,240
Keep firing! Keep firing!

817
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:12,387
Skadoosh.

818
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:43,961
How did you...

819
01:15:45,379 --> 01:15:47,005
How did you do it?

820
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:53,470
You know, you just keep your elbows up and keep the shoulders loose.

821
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:56,807
Not that. How did you find peace?

822
01:15:56,974 --> 01:16:00,644
I took away your parents. Everything.

823
01:16:00,811 --> 01:16:03,188
I scarred you for life.

824
01:16:03,814 --> 01:16:07,317
See, that's the thing, Shen. Scars heal.

825
01:16:07,484 --> 01:16:11,488
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

826
01:16:11,655 --> 01:16:14,074
Oh, yeah. What do scars do? They fade, I guess?

827
01:16:14,241 --> 01:16:18,662
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

828
01:16:18,829 --> 01:16:22,749
You gotta let go of that stuff from the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

829
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:27,421
The only thing that matters is what you choose to be now.

830
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:29,006
You're right.

831
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:31,550
Then I choose... this!

832
01:17:24,353 --> 01:17:26,563
That was pretty hard-core.

833
01:17:35,906 --> 01:17:36,990
- Po!
- You did it!

834
01:17:37,157 --> 01:17:40,244
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

835
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:44,081
It seems you have found inner peace.

836
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:46,583
And at such a young age.

837
01:17:46,750 --> 01:17:48,627
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

838
01:18:09,606 --> 01:18:13,277
What do you mean he's not here? It's my son's birthday.

839
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:15,821
All he wanted was to meet the Dragon Warrior.

840
01:18:15,988 --> 01:18:18,740
How about some tofu birthday cake instead, huh?

841
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:21,743
You know, I think we'll just try again another time.

842
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,287
When do you think he'll be back?

843
01:18:26,248 --> 01:18:30,252
I don't know. Okay, I don't know. Maybe never.

844
01:18:30,419 --> 01:18:33,755
I mean, I worry, okay? But that's my job, I'm his dad.

845
01:18:33,922 --> 01:18:36,133
At least, I was his dad.

846
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:39,928
Why did he have to go and save China? I know why.

847
01:18:40,095 --> 01:18:43,807
But why? He's just one little panda.

848
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:03,118
So, how did it go? Did you save China?

849
01:19:04,119 --> 01:19:05,495
Yep.

850
01:19:05,662 --> 01:19:07,956
Well, I knew you would.

851
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,875
That's why I had new signs made.

852
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:12,294
"My son saved China. You, too, can save.

853
01:19:12,461 --> 01:19:14,963
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

854
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,507
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

855
01:19:16,673 --> 01:19:19,343
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

856
01:19:22,137 --> 01:19:24,223
There's something I should tell you.

857
01:19:27,017 --> 01:19:31,438
While I was gone, I found the village where I was born.

858
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:36,527
I found out how I ended up in that radish basket.

859
01:19:36,693 --> 01:19:38,320
You did?

860
01:19:39,154 --> 01:19:43,075
- I know who I am.
- You do?

861
01:19:45,077 --> 01:19:46,703
I'm your son.

862
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:54,461
I love you, Dad.

863
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,381
I love you, too, son.

864
01:20:01,426 --> 01:20:03,470
Delicious, fat radishes!

865
01:20:03,637 --> 01:20:05,764
You're probably hungry. Let me make you something to eat.

866
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,683
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

867
01:20:07,850 --> 01:20:09,268
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

868
01:20:09,434 --> 01:20:11,562
Well, it's the least I can do. You saved China.

869
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,022
No, it's the least I can do. You raised me.

870
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:15,232
- Po.
- Dad.

871
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:16,859
- Po!
- Okay.

872
01:20:17,025 --> 01:20:19,653
Let's both cook. Together.

873
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:21,113
Together.

874
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:22,865
No, I'll cook.

875
01:20:57,774 --> 01:21:00,194
My son is alive.
