the princess?

1163
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:30,222
WOMAN 2: Where could she be?

1164
00:50:30,222 --> 00:50:30,856
WOMAN 3: Where is she?

1165
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:34,358
Princess Anna is in trouble.

1166
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:36,862
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her.

1167
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:38,862
I'll go.

1168
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:38,297
I volunteer.

1169
00:50:38,297 --> 00:50:39,599
I volunteer
two men, My Lord.

1170
00:50:40,599 --> 00:50:42,434
Be prepared for anything.

1171
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:45,436
And should you encounter
the queen,

1172
00:50:45,436 --> 00:50:47,306
you are to put an end
to this winter.

1173
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,306
Do you understand?

1174
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,579
Hmm.

1175
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:56,449
So, how exactly
are you planning
to stop this weather?

1176
00:50:57,449 --> 00:50:59,684
Oh. I am gonna
talk to my sister.

1177
00:50:59,684 --> 00:51:01,652
That's your plan?

1178
00:51:01,652 --> 00:51:04,155
My ice business is riding on
you talking to your sister?

1179
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:06,155
Yep.

1180
00:51:04,155 --> 00:51:06,291
(GRUNTS)

1181
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,793
So, you're not at all
afraid of her?

1182
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:10,793
Why would I be?

1183
00:51:07,793 --> 00:51:10,128
Yeah.

1184
00:51:10,128 --> 00:51:13,699
I bet she's the nicest,
gentlest, warmest person ever.

1185
00:51:14,699 --> 00:51:16,668
Oh. Look at that.

1186
00:51:16,668 --> 00:51:18,740
I've been impaled.
(CHUCKLING)

1187
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:23,576
What now?

1188
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,311
KRISTOFF: Mmm...

1189
00:51:27,311 --> 00:51:28,880
It's too steep.

1190
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,182
I've only got one rope
and you don't know
how to climb mountains.

1191
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:32,182
ANNA: Says who?

1192
00:51:31,182 --> 00:51:32,251
(GRUNTS)

1193
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:33,253
Hmm?

1194
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:35,521
What are you doing?

1195
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:39,657
I'm going to see my sister.

1196
00:51:39,657 --> 00:51:41,559
You're gonna
kill yourself.

1197
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,559
(GRUNTS)

1198
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,661
I wouldn't put
my foot there.

1199
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,661
You're distracting me.

1200
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:45,831
Or there.

1201
00:51:45,831 --> 00:51:47,666
How do you know
Elsa even wants to see you?

1202
00:51:47,666 --> 00:51:49,434
ANNA: All right.
I'm just blocking you out

1203
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:50,471
because I gotta
concentrate, here. (GRUNTING)

1204
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:53,771
You know,
most people who disappear

1205
00:51:53,771 --> 00:51:54,407
into the mountains
want to be alone.

1206
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,742
Nobody wants to be alone.

1207
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,344
Except maybe you.

1208
00:51:59,344 --> 00:52:01,282
I'm not alone.
I have friends, remember?

1209
00:52:03,282 --> 00:52:05,284
ANNA: You mean,
the love experts?

1210
00:52:05,284 --> 00:52:06,552
Yes, the love experts.

1211
00:52:07,552 --> 00:52:08,355
(GRUNTS) Ah...

1212
00:52:10,355 --> 00:52:11,358
Please tell me
I'm almost there.

1213
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:15,393
Does the air seem a bit thin
to you up here?

1214
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:16,393
(ANNA PANTING)

1215
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:16,628
(CHUCKLES)

1216
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:17,728
Hang on.

1217
00:52:17,728 --> 00:52:19,431
OLAF: Hey, Sven?

1218
00:52:19,431 --> 00:52:21,266
Not sure if this is gonna
solve the problem

1219
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:22,900
but I found a staircase
that leads exactly

1220
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:24,369
where you wanted to go.

1221
00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:26,304
Ha-ha! Thank goodness.
Catch!

1222
00:52:26,304 --> 00:52:28,306
(BOTH GRUNT)

1223
00:52:28,306 --> 00:52:29,420
Thanks. That was like
a crazy trust exercise.

1224
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,322
(OLAF CHUCKLING)

1225
00:52:44,322 --> 00:52:45,489
BOTH: Whoa.

1226
00:52:45,489 --> 00:52:46,293
Now, that's ice.

1227
00:52:48,293 --> 00:52:49,594
I might cry.

1228
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:51,664
Go ahead.
I won't judge.

1229
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:53,938
(GRUNTS)

1230
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,539
All right, take it easy,
boy. Come here.

1231
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:02,775
I got you. (GRUNTS)

1232
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:04,311
Okay. You stay
right here, buddy.

1233
00:53:06,311 --> 00:53:07,612
(WHISTLES)

1234
00:53:07,612 --> 00:53:08,985
Flawless.

1235
00:53:13,985 --> 00:53:14,255
Knock.

1236
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:17,889
Just knock.

1237
00:53:18,889 --> 00:53:19,492
Why isn't
she knocking?

1238
00:53:21,492 --> 00:53:22,297
Do you think
she knows how to knock?

1239
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,599
(GASPS)

1240
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:29,601
(EXHALES) Huh.
It opened.

1241
00:53:29,601 --> 00:53:31,869
That's a first.

1242
00:53:31,869 --> 00:53:34,572
Oh. You should probably
wait out here.

1243
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,572
What?

1244
00:53:34,572 --> 00:53:36,375
The last time
I introduced her to a guy,

1245
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:37,842
she froze everything.

1246
00:53:37,842 --> 00:53:39,978
But, but...
Oh, come on!

1247
00:53:39,978 --> 00:53:42,614
It's a palace made of ice.
Ice is my life!

1248
00:53:42,614 --> 00:53:43,648
Bye, Sven.

1249
00:53:43,648 --> 00:53:45,817
You, too, Olaf.

1250
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:46,817
Me?

1251
00:53:45,817 --> 00:53:46,719
Just give us a minute.

1252
00:53:47,719 --> 00:53:48,355
Okay.

1253
00:53:50,355 --> 00:53:51,657
(SOFTLY) One, two,

1254
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:53,657
three...

1255
00:53:52,657 --> 00:53:53,563
BOTH: Four...

1256
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:00,836
Whoa.

1257
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:06,873
Elsa?

1258
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:09,442
It's me, Anna.

1259
00:54:10,442 --> 00:54:11,079
(EXCLAIMS)

1260
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:14,079
ELSA: Anna.

00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:14,351
(GASPS)

1262
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:22,088
Whoa. Elsa,
you look different.

1263
00:54:23,088 --> 00:54:24,023
It's a good different.

1264
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,724
And this place...

1265
00:54:26,724 --> 00:54:28,393
It's amazing.

1266
00:54:28,393 --> 00:54:29,795
Thank you.

1267
00:54:29,795 --> 00:54:32,963
I never knew
what I was capable of.

1268
00:54:32,963 --> 00:54:35,067
I'm so sorry
about what happened.
If I'd have known...

1269
00:54:35,067 --> 00:54:36,001
No, no, no. It's okay.

1270
00:54:37,001 --> 00:54:40,373
You don't have
to apologize, but you
should probably go.

1271
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:42,641
Please.

1272
00:54:42,641 --> 00:54:43,675
But I just got here.

1273
00:54:44,675 --> 00:54:45,344
You belong down
in Arendelle.

1274
00:54:46,344 --> 00:54:47,612
So do you.

1275
00:54:47,612 --> 00:54:49,581
No, Anna,
I belong here.

1276
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:52,583
Alone.

1277
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:56,655
Where I can be who I am
without hurting anybody.

1278
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:59,523
Actually, about that...

1279
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,523
OLAF: Sixty!

1280
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:01,827
Wait. What is that?

1281
00:55:01,827 --> 00:55:03,695
Hi! I'm Olaf
and I like warm hugs!

1282
00:55:04,695 --> 00:55:05,731
Olaf?

1283
00:55:06,731 --> 00:55:07,367
Yeah. You built me.

1284
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:09,934
Remember that?

1285
00:55:09,934 --> 00:55:10,137
And you're alive?

1286
00:55:12,137 --> 00:55:13,907
(STAMMERS) Um...
I think so.

1287
00:55:15,907 --> 00:55:17,378
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

1288
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:20,079
Yeah.

1289
00:55:21,079 --> 00:55:22,648
Elsa, we were so close.

1290
00:55:23,648 --> 00:55:24,985
We can be like
that again.

We can't. Goodbye, Anna.

Elsa, wait.

No, I'm just trying
to protect you.

You don't have to protect me.
