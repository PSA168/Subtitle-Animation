1
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:44,880
The universe...

2
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,716
a vast expanse of space and matter.

3
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,920
It includes all that we see,
and all that we know.

4
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,513
Since the beginning of time,

5
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,275
we have wondered how it came to be.

6
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,001
A gloriously orchestrated plan?

7
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,597
A chance series of events?

8
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,160
Or something much, much dumber?

9
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:22,632
Aha!

10
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,151
Eee!

11
00:05:22,998 --> 00:05:26,562
It's a beautiful day out here
on the ice as father meets daughter

12
00:05:26,678 --> 00:05:28,521
in a quest for hockey supremacy.

13
00:05:28,678 --> 00:05:29,884
It's Peaches meets Manny.

14
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,199
Mammoth meets mammoth.

15
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:32,445
Mano a mano.

16
00:05:32,518 --> 00:05:33,485
Meema me moo-ma.

17
00:05:33,558 --> 00:05:34,605
Mama may mee-mee.

18
00:05:34,838 --> 00:05:36,283
Will you two quit it?

19
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:37,679
M-okay.

20
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:38,805
Meanie.

21
00:05:38,878 --> 00:05:40,846
The blazing mammoth
takes it on the breakaway.

22
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,723
There's never been a player
so tough, so graceful.

23
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:45,528
So desperate to score.

24
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,886
He fakes right. He fakes left.

25
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:49,962
He fakes knowing how to play.

26
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:52,880
- Huh?
- What's wrong?

27
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,609
Lose something?

28
00:05:54,799 --> 00:05:57,279
Hey, what's that stink
I smell out there? It's Manny!

29
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,362
Hey, hey. It's Manny!

30
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,566
Whoo! You stink!

31
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,370
Okay, Fuzzball. Let's see what you got.

32
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,049
You asked for it.

33
00:06:12,559 --> 00:06:15,642
Yes! She dominates! Again.

34
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,801
Oh, please. I went easy on you.

35
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,324
It's called good parenting.

36
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,801
Yeah, right. Face it.

37
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,325
I rule the ice now.

38
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,642
Oh, you talk a big game, hotshot.

39
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,404
All right, how about best of three?

40
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,961
Whoo-hoo! Yes! Touchdown!

41
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,930
Wait, no, that's not right.
Not touchdown. What is it?

42
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,401
Uh, hole-in-one! Whoo!

43
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,481
- Julian!
- Whoa!

44
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,561
- Ow!
- Sorry.

45
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,409
Honey, I scored! Did you see me?

46
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,928
Yeah! And you were amazing. Whoa! Whoa!

47
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,401
Careful!

48
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,681
Oh, the ice is really icy.

49
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,844
It's like super-sized, extra value icy.

50
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,002
But I'm getting better, right?

51
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,481
Whoa!

52
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,288
Okay, we'll play... later.

53
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:01,808
So, she whupped your butt again, huh?

54
00:07:01,961 --> 00:07:03,929
And with a butt that size,

55
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,691
that's a whole lot of whuppin'.

56
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:08,321
Nobody was whupped. There was no whupping.

57
00:07:08,481 --> 00:07:09,721
It's just a loving father

58
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:11,849
sharing some strategy
with his only daughter.

59
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:14,481
Didn't know sucking was a strategy.

60
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,452
Okay, it's our turn.

61
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,330
Let's show them how it's done!

62
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,686
You're going down, eh?

63
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,443
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

64
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,202
Ta-ta-da-da!

65
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,648
For you, my mom-in-law-to-be.

66
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,802
Buttercups!

67
00:07:31,961 --> 00:07:33,487
Nature's sunshine.

68
00:07:33,642 --> 00:07:36,088
Isn't sunshine nature's sunshine?

69
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:38,529
Aw! Thank you, Julian.

70
00:07:38,642 --> 00:07:41,532
It's been so long
since anyone's given me flowers.

71
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:43,571
But you're marrying our daughter.

72
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:45,531
You don't have to
keep bringing us presents.

73
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,172
But it makes me happy.

74
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:51,646
And for you, my guru,
my rock, my main mammoth...

75
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:54,885
To you, I give the greatest gift of all.

76
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:57,204
Wait. What are you doing?

77
00:07:57,362 --> 00:08:00,013
Come on, Bro-Dad. Bring it in.

78
00:08:01,842 --> 00:08:03,287
Oh!

79
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:05,171
I can feel your heart beating.

80
00:08:05,322 --> 00:08:07,848
Okay. That's enough of that.

81
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:09,813
You better get used to it.

82
00:08:09,883 --> 00:08:11,328
They'll be living right next door.

83
00:08:11,683 --> 00:08:13,048
Come on, Julian. Wanna go?

84
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:17,049
Actually, weren't you gonna
help me with the thing?

85
00:08:17,203 --> 00:08:19,683
Oh! Right. The thing.

86
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:20,924
Gotta do the thing.

87
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,369
I can do the thing.

88
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:23,524
No!

89
00:08:24,363 --> 00:08:26,206
It's a girl thing.

90
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:29,454
Hey! Why don't you go do a guy thing?

91
00:08:29,603 --> 00:08:31,770
You know, you don't spend nearly
enough time with your friends.

92
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,045
- I don't?
- I'll see you later.

93
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:37,366
On this special day.

94
00:08:37,523 --> 00:08:38,888
Uh... Okay.

95
00:08:39,523 --> 00:08:41,207
Have you told them about our decision yet?

96
00:08:41,363 --> 00:08:43,764
No. I'm waiting for the right time.

97
00:08:43,923 --> 00:08:46,052
Come on, Romeo. Walk with me.

98
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,411
I'm gonna watch some butterflies
come out of their cocoons.

99
00:08:48,604 --> 00:08:50,368
- Whoa! Really?
- No.

100
00:08:50,604 --> 00:08:52,094
Goodbye, sweetie.

101
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:56,647
Aw! I remember when Manny
and I used to be like that.

102
00:08:56,804 --> 00:08:59,011
Not me! Love them and leave them,

103
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,449
and take half of everything.

104
00:09:00,604 --> 00:09:01,890
That's my motto.

105
00:09:05,284 --> 00:09:08,970
Mi amor, so many ladies
have tried and failed...

106
00:09:09,164 --> 00:09:12,566
to strap a saddle on Sid the stallion.

107
00:09:14,164 --> 00:09:16,770
But I want to share everything with you.

108
00:09:16,964 --> 00:09:19,205
You're the wind beneath my fleas,

109
00:09:19,284 --> 00:09:20,775
the algae of my eye.

110
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:24,773
Will you be my mate for life?

111
00:09:28,965 --> 00:09:30,296
- Sidney?
- Mmm?

112
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:31,936
Sidney, where are you?

113
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:35,166
Francine.

114
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,246
I need to ask...

115
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:40,570
Ow!

116
00:09:40,805 --> 00:09:42,694
I need to ask you something.

117
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:43,806
Will you marry...

118
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:45,336
Sid, I'm gonna stop you right there.

119
00:09:45,485 --> 00:09:46,691
I'm breaking up with you.

120
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:49,166
What? But I planned our whole future!

121
00:09:49,325 --> 00:09:50,850
Our wedding.

122
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:52,046
Our kids.

123
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,092
Mommy.

124
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:54,371
Our burial plots.

125
00:09:54,445 --> 00:09:55,413
How you doing?

126
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:56,976
I even hired a band.

127
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:58,457
Hey!

128
00:09:58,526 --> 00:09:59,891
No, no. Not yet!

129
00:10:00,606 --> 00:10:02,973
Are you crazy? We've only had one date.

130
00:10:03,126 --> 00:10:04,537
It lasted 14 minutes!

131
00:10:04,726 --> 00:10:07,206
Yes, but it felt like 20.

132
00:10:07,366 --> 00:10:08,413
Ugh!

133
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:09,817
I can't! A ring?

134
00:10:09,886 --> 00:10:11,012
I mean, I like the ring, but no.

135
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,656
I can't. You're too clingy.

136
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:15,286
How is this clingy?

137
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,606
And by the way,

138
00:10:16,686 --> 00:10:18,893
you look nothing like
your profile picture.

139
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:20,651
Francine, you gotta start dating

140
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:21,887
outside of your species.

141
00:10:22,046 --> 00:10:26,256
Franny, we can work this out.
Is this about the bikini? Ow!

142
00:10:27,646 --> 00:10:29,648
I didn't know it was poison ivy.

143
00:10:34,007 --> 00:10:35,975
Oh! Uh-oh.

144
00:10:36,047 --> 00:10:38,527
Franny. Franny, help!

145
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:40,098
Somebody.

146
00:10:40,247 --> 00:10:42,170
Is it the eyes that hurt...

147
00:10:42,327 --> 00:10:43,658
or my soul?

148
00:10:43,847 --> 00:10:44,894
Ow!

149
00:10:45,007 --> 00:10:47,009
Definitely the eyes.

150
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:54,533
Ah, women!

151
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,018
Yeah, women.

152
00:10:56,767 --> 00:10:57,768
What about them?

153
00:10:57,847 --> 00:10:59,531
I don't get 'em.

154
00:11:00,167 --> 00:11:02,898
Like, Ellie. Life's great with her.

155
00:11:03,047 --> 00:11:05,778
There's no surprises.
Nothing ever changes.

156
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,454
But then today, she giggled.

157
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,212
Does Shira ever just giggle?

158
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,812
Please don't eat me!

159
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:16,136
Uh... Shira's not a big giggler.

160
00:11:16,288 --> 00:11:17,858
Well, Ellie giggled.

161
00:11:18,048 --> 00:11:19,379
And then she wiggled.

162
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,371
"Tee hee hee hee." Boom!

163
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:22,939
Don't ever do that again.

164
00:11:23,088 --> 00:11:25,250
I have no idea why she's acting so weird.

165
00:11:25,408 --> 00:11:26,819
Women.

166
00:11:26,888 --> 00:11:29,016
Women.

167
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:30,929
Hello?

168
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:33,290
And speaking of weird.

169
00:11:33,648 --> 00:11:35,457
Anybody there? Oh!

170
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:37,809
Marco? Polo?

171
00:11:40,088 --> 00:11:41,089
Oh, hi, Manny.

172
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,414
Ew! Your breath is awful.

173
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,570
What happened to you?

174
00:11:44,649 --> 00:11:46,333
Oh, nothing. Everything's great.

175
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,810
Fabulous. Zippity-dippity.

176
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:51,495
Okay, let me guess. She dumped you.

177
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,731
What is wrong with me?

178
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:56,457
Everybody has somebody.

179
00:11:56,609 --> 00:11:59,260
And all I've got is my boyish good looks

180
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,093
and this mariachi band.

181
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,174
Oh! So itchy!

182
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,378
Come on. Let's get you cleaned up.

183
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:11,450
Ahh!

184
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:55,372
Whoa!

185
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,614
All I wanted is true love.

186
00:14:43,774 --> 00:14:46,254
Is that too much to ask?

187
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:50,334
Why is it so quiet?

188
00:14:50,494 --> 00:14:53,065
Because the world is mourning my loss.

189
00:14:54,254 --> 00:14:55,494
Ellie?

190
00:14:56,014 --> 00:14:57,095
Peaches?

191
00:14:57,574 --> 00:14:58,939
Where is everyone?

192
00:14:59,094 --> 00:15:00,095
Surprise!

193
00:15:05,094 --> 00:15:07,096
Uh... Huh?

194
00:15:10,454 --> 00:15:11,455
Ta-da!

195
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:13,458
Happy Anniversary, honey!

196
00:15:13,614 --> 00:15:14,775
Anniversary?

197
00:15:15,294 --> 00:15:17,946
Oh, no. That's the thing.

198
00:15:19,775 --> 00:15:22,301
Okay! Now it's your turn, Bro-Dad!

199
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,184
Yeah! We wanna see what you got Ellie.

200
00:15:24,335 --> 00:15:25,461
Manny!

201
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:28,778
Manny! Manny! Manny!

202
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:30,619
Manny!

203
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,897
Hey, hey. Right.

204
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,904
Uh...

205
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,704
How about another hand for Ellie?

206
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,021
Yeah.

207
00:15:38,455 --> 00:15:39,456
Oh.

208
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,181
He forgot!

209
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,899
I feel so bad for Ellie.

210
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:48,137
Ellie, I... Uh...

211
00:15:58,496 --> 00:16:01,579
Ooh! Ah!

212
00:16:01,656 --> 00:16:03,226
He didn't forget.

213
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,743
That's how big Manny's love is for her!

214
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,543
Nice save with the light show.

215
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:13,700
Wait, you didn't do this? Then who did?

216
00:16:13,896 --> 00:16:15,421
Oh, Manny.

217
00:16:15,576 --> 00:16:17,658
I was so afraid you'd forgotten.

218
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:20,177
But you lit up the sky for me?

219
00:16:20,336 --> 00:16:21,701
How'd you do it?

220
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:23,137
Uh, well...

221
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:25,901
A magician never reveals his secrets.

222
00:16:26,016 --> 00:16:27,621
Oh...

223
00:16:27,697 --> 00:16:29,062
Thank you.

224
00:16:37,457 --> 00:16:39,585
I keep picturing our own kid in there.

225
00:16:39,737 --> 00:16:41,227
He'd be the best one.

226
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,543
I think you meant "she."

227
00:16:42,617 --> 00:16:43,698
He.

228
00:16:44,217 --> 00:16:46,379
Either way, we've been over this, Diego.

229
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:47,777
Kids are afraid of us.

230
00:16:47,937 --> 00:16:49,382
Yeah, but why?

231
00:16:53,297 --> 00:16:55,140
Are they gonna eat us?

232
00:16:55,297 --> 00:16:56,298
Hi, kids!

233
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:01,858
I even smiled this time.

234
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:10,579
Wow, Dad.

235
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,388
Best present ever.

236
00:17:12,578 --> 00:17:16,060
You, sir, are an education
in marital excellence.

237
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:18,664
I'm really gonna miss you guys
when we leave.

238
00:17:20,058 --> 00:17:21,059
Ow!

239
00:17:21,698 --> 00:17:24,622
Um, actually, I haven't told them yet.

240
00:17:25,098 --> 00:17:26,259
Oh.

241
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,749
Surprise!

242
00:17:27,898 --> 00:17:28,865
You're leaving?

243
00:17:28,938 --> 00:17:31,505
I thought you guys were gonna live
with us the first couple of years.

244
00:17:31,658 --> 00:17:35,063
I know. But Julian and I
kind of want to roam for a while.

245
00:17:35,218 --> 00:17:36,299
- Roam?
- Yeah!

246
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,463
Travel, explore, just go wherever.

247
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:42,589
No plan is the best plan.
That's my philosophy.

248
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,260
Hors d'oeuvres?

249
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,347
That's not a plan, or a philosophy...

250
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:47,739
or very safe.

251
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:49,664
Dad, we're young.

252
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,265
We can worry about being safe
when we're old and boring.

253
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:53,420
Like you and Mom.

254
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,508
- I think we should just...
- Excuse me!

255
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,149
This is a family discussion.

256
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,222
But aren't I part of your family?

257
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:00,864
Not yet, you're not.

258
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:07,060
Uh...

259
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,261
Does that look like a problem to you?

260
00:18:12,219 --> 00:18:14,507
A ball of fire heading
directly towards us?

261
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,991
Why would that be a problem?

262
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,710
What if you fall in a ditch
and get amnesia?

263
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,986
What then, huh?

264
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,187
Manny, we have a problem.

265
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,910
Not now. I have a problem.

266
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,141
This one's a little bigger.

267
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,745
- I don't think so.
- Manny!

268
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,061
What?

269
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,181
Manny?

270
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,946
Uh, okay. Party's over, everybody.

271
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,182
Have a good night. And leave right now!

272
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,581
What are you talking about?
The party just got started.

273
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:39,741
Yeah.

274
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,022
Just getting kind of sleepy.

275
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,104
Everyone should go.
And duck. Possibly cover!

276
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,223
Hey, what's gotten into you?

277
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,586
Look! There's more coming!

278
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:01,265
Meteor shower!

279
00:19:02,021 --> 00:19:03,227
Meteor?

280
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:04,342
Shower?

281
00:19:06,941 --> 00:19:09,228
Manny's love is killing us!

282
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,191
I suppose this is all part
of your magic show for me?

283
00:19:12,261 --> 00:19:13,990
Abracadabra?

284
00:19:14,141 --> 00:19:15,586
Can you guys deal with this later?

285
00:19:15,741 --> 00:19:17,391
Come on. We need to take cover.

286
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,748
Whoo-hoo! I'm on fire!

287
00:19:24,021 --> 00:19:27,583
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Me too!
We're smoking hot, baby!

288
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,308
Incoming!

289
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,748
Those are ours!

290
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:35,625
Are you okay? How many tusks do you see?

291
00:19:35,702 --> 00:19:36,703
Tree.

292
00:19:36,782 --> 00:19:37,783
Three?

293
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,705
No! Tree!

294
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:49,791
Everybody, jump!

295
00:19:58,302 --> 00:19:59,906
Whee!

296
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:02,426
The cave! Get inside!

297
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:03,869
Move! Move!

298
00:20:06,343 --> 00:20:07,947
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

299
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:16,590
Oh!

300
00:20:16,663 --> 00:20:18,506
It's okay, sweetheart. Daddy's...

301
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:31,387
Hey, it sounds like it's slowing down.

302
00:20:32,903 --> 00:20:34,985
Yup, it's definitely over.

303
00:20:39,984 --> 00:20:42,032
Except for that one.

304
00:20:43,624 --> 00:20:44,830
We might wanna think

305
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:47,191
about moving underground for a while.

306
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:09,787
Look at that! I got an egg.

307
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:11,628
How many eggs did you poach,
little brother?

308
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:13,315
Do we have to steal other creatures' eggs?

309
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,035
I mean, couldn't we just go vegan?

310
00:21:15,185 --> 00:21:16,755
Sure, we could eat vegans.

311
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,873
Whoops! Oh-oh-oh!

312
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,868
Son, sometimes I wonder

313
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:22,788
how you snuck into this family.

314
00:21:22,945 --> 00:21:24,151
Figaro, Figaro

315
00:21:24,225 --> 00:21:27,946
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

316
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:31,348
With you in a minute.
I'll have to rinse and repeat.

317
00:21:31,465 --> 00:21:34,071
That weasel is such a buzzkill.

318
00:21:34,265 --> 00:21:35,630
Let's go, kids.

319
00:21:35,785 --> 00:21:37,025
Don't worry, ma'am.

320
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:38,874
I'll catch the crew that poached your egg.

321
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:42,155
It's a pun!

322
00:21:42,225 --> 00:21:43,795
I'm winking under the eye patch.

323
00:21:45,545 --> 00:21:48,675
A mother is crying
A damsel in distress

324
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:52,474
Foreboding intruders Have made such a mess

325
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,310
What I detect is a lack of respect

326
00:21:54,386 --> 00:21:55,797
For all that is precious and dear

327
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:59,349
I am the pint-sized protector
Of this lost world

328
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,954
But my friends call me Buck.

329
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:04,116
Well played, guys.

330
00:22:05,386 --> 00:22:08,390
I have a message, bullies not welcome

331
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:09,627
Return what you've stolen

332
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,231
Go back where you came from

333
00:22:13,426 --> 00:22:16,675
You know I'm greater, so don't be a hater
You may be Jurassic, but I am fantastic

334
00:22:16,826 --> 00:22:21,309
Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

335
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:24,630
Figaro

336
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:26,990
Oh, love that bit.

337
00:22:27,147 --> 00:22:28,433
Running and climbing
And spinning and grinning

338
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:31,072
And dashing and diving and dodging
And sliding and gliding and staying alive

339
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,228
And these are a few of the things
That I do before lunch

340
00:22:33,307 --> 00:22:35,469
Death defying, danger denying

341
00:22:35,627 --> 00:22:36,913
Look, I'm flying

342
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,308
You might think I'm mad
But, hey, you only live once

343
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:41,390
No need to thank me

344
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,469
But if you insist, I won't resist

345
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:45,715
Who smells like fish?

346
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:47,835
- Huh?
- Hold on to your butts!

347
00:22:47,987 --> 00:22:48,988
Class

348
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:59,676
Dismissed

349
00:23:02,668 --> 00:23:03,874
Good egg.

350
00:23:10,668 --> 00:23:11,999
Here you are, my lady.

351
00:23:17,468 --> 00:23:18,515
Huh?

352
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:20,670
Go! I'll lead them away.

353
00:23:24,628 --> 00:23:26,073
Oh, that was fun!

354
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:28,230
Same time, same place, next week?

355
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:30,470
Toodles!

356
00:23:30,948 --> 00:23:33,269
Congratulations, weasel.

357
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:36,279
You just signed your death warrant.

358
00:23:38,069 --> 00:23:40,436
Weaseled my way out of that one.

359
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:43,514
Hmm. What's all that
flash and dazzle about?

360
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:44,636
Oh!

361
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:47,189
Who puts a rock in the middle
of the jungle?

362
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:48,475
Ow!

363
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:58,590
Mmm.

364
00:24:01,749 --> 00:24:02,750
Ooh.

365
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,991
Ha!

366
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,475
Blimey!

367
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,994
What is this place?

368
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,511
Whoops!

369
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:48,562
Hmm.

370
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:38,673
Uh...

371
00:25:39,432 --> 00:25:40,672
Hello?

372
00:25:57,353 --> 00:25:58,684
Yeah!

373
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,842
Oh! Hello, mammals.

374
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:02,114
Hi, Buck!

375
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,003
Hi.

376
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,274
Bye, Buck!

377
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,234
Um, a little help.

378
00:26:14,193 --> 00:26:16,036
Right on the spleen!

379
00:26:16,193 --> 00:26:18,400
Utterly useless, but totally hurts.

380
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:20,999
Hey, Buck. Welcome back, buddy.

381
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:23,997
Wait. This half-a-snack
is the dinosaur whisperer?

382
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,440
And expert salsa dancer.

383
00:26:29,593 --> 00:26:30,640
Whoo!

384
00:26:30,713 --> 00:26:32,842
I have one eye but all my original teeth.

385
00:26:33,034 --> 00:26:35,002
Would you like to count them? Ah...

386
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:36,405
No, thank you.

387
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:40,318
And this must be Nectarine.

388
00:26:40,634 --> 00:26:41,920
Um... Peaches.

389
00:26:41,994 --> 00:26:43,120
Semantics, my dear.

390
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:44,605
I am deeply honored.

391
00:26:45,234 --> 00:26:48,363
Sweet eye patch. Very gangsta.

392
00:26:48,514 --> 00:26:49,561
Thank you.

393
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:51,722
- I like this kid.
- Buck.

394
00:26:52,234 --> 00:26:53,884
- Whoa!
- What are you doing here?

395
00:26:54,034 --> 00:26:55,445
Well, I... What?

396
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:57,280
I'm trying!

397
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:59,875
But how do you tell someone
they're doomed?

398
00:27:00,594 --> 00:27:02,483
He's stumped.

399
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:03,601
We're not doomed, Buck.

400
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,325
It was just a meteor shower,
and the show's over.

401
00:27:06,394 --> 00:27:07,395
Ahh!

402
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:08,761
Oh, quite the contrary, old chap.

403
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,997
It's just beginning.

404
00:27:11,195 --> 00:27:14,199
You see, I found a prophecy.

405
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:21,396
Do you mind?

406
00:27:22,115 --> 00:27:25,198
Boy, he really sucks the fun
out of everything. Doesn't he?

407
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:26,481
Fun sucker!

408
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,923
I read this tablet front to back.

409
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,680
And the story it tells is very disturbing.

410
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:34,122
Every hundred million years or so,

411
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,357
the world gets a cosmic cleansing.

412
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:37,886
Before the dinosaurs,

413
00:27:37,955 --> 00:27:40,925
there were these horseshoe
crab-looking thingies.

414
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,241
Ugh! Yuck.

415
00:27:42,435 --> 00:27:44,245
Then, at the bottom
of this mountain range,

416
00:27:44,356 --> 00:27:45,642
an asteroid hit.

417
00:27:45,796 --> 00:27:47,958
Boom! Bye-bye.

418
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:51,245
Next, dinosaurs, mountain range, asteroid.

419
00:27:51,396 --> 00:27:52,761
Boom! Bye-bye.

420
00:27:52,916 --> 00:27:55,203
And coming up next, mammals.

421
00:27:55,276 --> 00:27:57,278
Mountain range, asteroid, boom!

422
00:27:59,756 --> 00:28:00,757
Bye-bye.

423
00:28:01,356 --> 00:28:02,721
Stupid mammals.

424
00:28:02,796 --> 00:28:04,082
That's us.

425
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:06,563
Mmm.

426
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:09,444
Yep, and there she is.

427
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:13,442
The mother of all asteroids
screaming towards us.

428
00:28:13,636 --> 00:28:16,116
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

429
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:18,643
Hey, that wasn't there before.

430
00:28:18,796 --> 00:28:20,720
And look what it's doing to the sky.

431
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:23,118
No worries. Because I've got a plan.

432
00:28:23,277 --> 00:28:25,848
Really? To stop an asteroid?

433
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:28,445
Look, the last two asteroids

434
00:28:28,517 --> 00:28:30,519
have pummeled the earth in the same spot.

435
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:32,600
And it's about to happen again.

436
00:28:32,757 --> 00:28:34,282
We've got to go there

437
00:28:34,357 --> 00:28:36,121
and see what's attracting the asteroid.

438
00:28:36,557 --> 00:28:38,127
Once we know why it's coming...

439
00:28:38,277 --> 00:28:40,518
we can figure out how to send it
somewhere else.

440
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,202
That plan is so dumb,

441
00:28:42,277 --> 00:28:44,564
I wish it had a face so I could smack it.

442
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:45,764
Let me get this straight.

443
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,403
Instead of running away
from a deadly asteroid...

444
00:28:48,557 --> 00:28:50,764
you want us to run directly towards it?

445
00:28:50,917 --> 00:28:53,887
I know it sounds suboptimal,
but the good news is...

446
00:28:54,037 --> 00:28:56,245
it'll kill us no matter where we went.

447
00:28:56,398 --> 00:28:58,048
Well, that's reassuring.

448
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,519
Okay, but even if
we get to the crash site...

449
00:29:00,678 --> 00:29:02,123
how are we supposed to change

450
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,644
what is literally written in stone?

451
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:06,887
Ah, my cynical friend.

452
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,086
The dinos were wiped off
the face of the Earth,

453
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:10,887
but some escaped.

454
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:13,882
They changed their fate
and we can change ours, too.

455
00:29:14,038 --> 00:29:15,881
Who's with me?

456
00:29:19,318 --> 00:29:21,241
So, what do you think?

457
00:29:21,398 --> 00:29:23,526
Honestly, I'm worried the weasel's right.

458
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,726
No! Don't listen to the weasel.

459
00:29:25,918 --> 00:29:28,364
He's a raving loon!

460
00:29:29,558 --> 00:29:32,165
Sorry. I just love
playing devil's advocate.

461
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:34,640
And looking fabulous!

462
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,885
Well, Buck has saved
our lives before, right?

463
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,928
But what if he can't this time?

464
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,649
I don't know what to believe.

465
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,325
But I'm afraid our lives will be over

466
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:46,679
before they begin.

467
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,280
Okay.

468
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,362
I guess we're in.

469
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:57,007
Crash and Eddie reporting for duty.

470
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,644
Doody.

471
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,490
Excellent! And dirty word processed.

472
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,761
Now, we better get on the road
because time till impact is roughly...

473
00:30:05,879 --> 00:30:09,043
2 days, 4 hours, 1 minute and 16 seconds.

474
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,009
15 seconds, 14 seconds...

475
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,601
I think we get it.

476
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,525
I think we're all gonna get it.

477
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,368
Whoo! We look so cool.

478
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,561
Whoa!

479
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,762
Ugh. What is this stuff?

480
00:30:54,321 --> 00:30:57,086
Where is he? When I am through
with that one-eyed weasel...

481
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,209
he's going to need two eye patches.

482
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,322
I admire your bloodthirstitude, Gertie.

483
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:04,562
But you heard them.

484
00:31:04,721 --> 00:31:06,644
An asteroid is coming.

485
00:31:06,761 --> 00:31:09,571
This changes things.

486
00:31:12,281 --> 00:31:14,522
Holy snowballs! It's freezing up here.

487
00:31:14,681 --> 00:31:16,888
Parts are retracting into other parts.

488
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,488
Would you please stop acting
like a parakeet?

489
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:22,329
It's a good thing
you got your mother's eyes...

490
00:31:22,482 --> 00:31:24,211
or you'd be totally useless.

491
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,046
Well, that's just hurtful.

492
00:31:29,682 --> 00:31:30,922
What do you see?

493
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:34,533
Nothing. Nothing.

494
00:31:35,202 --> 00:31:37,364
Deadly asteroid screaming towards Earth.

495
00:31:38,202 --> 00:31:39,931
Wait! There he is.

496
00:31:40,082 --> 00:31:43,052
That's too bad. He is really far away.

497
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,931
Probably too far to reach by flight.

498
00:31:45,002 --> 00:31:46,242
Oh, well. Let's just go home.

499
00:31:46,842 --> 00:31:48,606
We are not retreating!

500
00:31:48,762 --> 00:31:50,491
Until that weasel came along...

501
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,724
our family made an honest living

502
00:31:52,802 --> 00:31:54,009
stealing dino eggs.

503
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:56,484
An honest living. Stealing.

504
00:31:56,563 --> 00:31:57,928
Kind of ironic, don't you think?

505
00:31:58,363 --> 00:32:00,604
Besides, why take out the weasel

506
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:02,526
if the asteroid is just gonna take us out?

507
00:32:02,683 --> 00:32:05,209
So much sight. So little vision.

508
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:07,684
If we stop the weasel and his friends

509
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:09,447
from diverting the asteroid...

510
00:32:09,603 --> 00:32:10,604
Kablooie!

511
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,254
It kills the weasel and everyone else...

512
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:17,249
while we glide safely above it all.

513
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:20,088
It'll be our paradise.

514
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,804
That's seems highly implausible.

515
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,694
Just from a scientific standpoint.

516
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:29,455
Fine. It's a great plan. Dynamite!

517
00:32:29,644 --> 00:32:30,725
One of the top three or four

518
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:32,568
species annihilation plans
I've ever heard.

519
00:32:32,724 --> 00:32:34,010
That's better.

520
00:32:34,164 --> 00:32:37,885
Now let's make sure that asteroid hits.

521
00:32:38,444 --> 00:32:40,128
Why can't we just fear the apocalypse

522
00:32:40,244 --> 00:32:41,484
like a normal family?

523
00:33:05,965 --> 00:33:06,966
Whoa!

524
00:33:15,205 --> 00:33:16,206
Mmm.

525
00:33:29,445 --> 00:33:30,446
Mmm?

526
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:23,453
What are you doing, Buck?

527
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:25,450
All rocks tell a tale.

528
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,217
Where we've been and where we're heading.

529
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,057
Ah!

530
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:35,607
That, however, is a turd.

531
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:40,773
Julian...

532
00:34:40,927 --> 00:34:44,056
I want you to know
that if we don't make it...

533
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,369
if we never get married...

534
00:34:46,527 --> 00:34:48,052
you were the only one for me.

535
00:34:48,247 --> 00:34:50,295
Hey, come on!

536
00:34:50,447 --> 00:34:53,179
Of course we'll make it,
and we will get married.

537
00:34:53,328 --> 00:34:55,729
But maybe it's the universe
telling us we won't.

538
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,168
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

539
00:34:57,248 --> 00:34:59,615
You're going to let one tiny little...

540
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:02,772
300-mile-wide asteroid ruin your plans?

541
00:35:02,968 --> 00:35:05,619
How can we think about our future
when we may not have one?

542
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:08,494
Hey, we're going to stop this thing
and you'll get married.

543
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:10,497
Bada-bing, bada-boom!

544
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:12,975
Well, not boom. Forget I said boom.

545
00:35:14,448 --> 00:35:16,815
I know! I'll be your wedding planner!

546
00:35:16,968 --> 00:35:20,092
It'll take your mind
off all this end-of-the-world stuff.

547
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:22,649
Actually, we were just gonna wing it!

548
00:35:22,728 --> 00:35:23,775
Keep it low-key.

549
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,333
What?

550
00:35:25,488 --> 00:35:27,139
Peaches, Peaches. Sweetheart,

551
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,014
you don't just wing
the happiest day of your life!

552
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:33,179
No, you seize it and you cherish it.

553
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:35,696
You strangle it with good intentions.

554
00:35:36,689 --> 00:35:38,817
Ooh. Let's start with your hair.

555
00:35:39,729 --> 00:35:42,494
Updo with a top bun? Traditional.

556
00:35:42,649 --> 00:35:46,620
Or updo with a fishtail braid.
Flirtatious.

557
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:49,931
But maybe a little trashy.

558
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:52,174
Ugh.

559
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:53,739
And garter belts!

560
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:56,900
Today, Ed is modelling laced daisies.

561
00:35:57,049 --> 00:35:59,416
While Crash is rocking
a more elegant ivy...

562
00:35:59,609 --> 00:36:01,373
that's all about the calves.

563
00:36:01,689 --> 00:36:03,294
Ooh. We need a seating chart!

564
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:05,811
The singles table, the kids table,

565
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,221
the weird relatives table...

566
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,254
the smelly table, two more smelly tables.

567
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,776
Look at him.

568
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,420
Oh, you're gonna love it.

569
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,981
Who walks like that?

570
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,133
Oh! Look at me.

571
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,416
I'm Julian.

572
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:19,935
Forget the asteroid.

573
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,258
Gimme a hug, Bro-Dad!

574
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:24,731
Look at that pretty bird there.

575
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:29,858
Yeah! That is a pretty bird.
Good eye, Manny.

576
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,455
Yeah.

577
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,856
The sky is literally falling...

578
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,296
and she thinks we're just gonna

579
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:35,821
let her stroll into the wilderness...

580
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,814
with Mr. No Plans Bouncy Walk.

581
00:36:37,971 --> 00:36:39,416
Stop picking on him.

582
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:42,296
Come on, El, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

583
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:43,856
No. I'm not still mad.

584
00:36:44,011 --> 00:36:45,536
Because that's not how I want to spend

585
00:36:45,611 --> 00:36:47,181
what could be our final days together.

586
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,896
But if we somehow survive

587
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:50,814
that planet-killing hunk of space rock...

588
00:36:50,971 --> 00:36:51,972
you're in for it.

589
00:36:52,131 --> 00:36:54,338
If we survive, we lose our daughter.

590
00:36:54,491 --> 00:36:56,380
Well, I've been thinking about that, too.

591
00:36:56,531 --> 00:36:57,942
What if...

592
00:36:58,131 --> 00:37:00,452
Ooh. I know! We destroy
the relationship, right?

593
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:02,215
That way we never have to let her go...

594
00:37:02,371 --> 00:37:05,136
and she'll just stay
our little girl forever!

595
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,814
No, you psychopath!

596
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:12,453
What if we convince them to stay near us?

597
00:37:12,611 --> 00:37:14,614
Oh! That's better.

598
00:37:14,812 --> 00:37:16,735
I like it. But how?

599
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:18,894
The way we always
get her to do what we want.

600
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:21,293
We make her think it's her idea.

601
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:24,815
You sneaky, sneaky minx!

602
00:37:24,892 --> 00:37:27,213
Let's just hope we haven't lost our touch.

603
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:28,538
Found it!

604
00:37:29,652 --> 00:37:31,177
Behold, mammals!

605
00:37:31,372 --> 00:37:34,342
A sneak preview of the asteroid to come.

606
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:37,974
A space rock. Fresh from the cosmos.

607
00:37:38,572 --> 00:37:39,903
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

608
00:37:39,972 --> 00:37:42,179
I taste iron, carbon.

609
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:45,659
Oh! And a hint of nickel.

610
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:48,656
Space tastes lonely.

611
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,662
Hey, look! I found another one.

612
00:37:50,853 --> 00:37:51,854
Me, too!

613
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,334
Hmm...

614
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:00,698
Hey! Yours is attracted to me.

615
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:03,333
No. Yours is attracted to me.

616
00:38:06,613 --> 00:38:09,014
We're just too attractive!

617
00:38:09,173 --> 00:38:11,096
Stupendous! Now we have something

618
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:13,016
to play with during our final hours.

619
00:38:13,373 --> 00:38:14,863
You're missing the point, Tiger.

620
00:38:15,013 --> 00:38:16,378
They're magnets.

621
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,415
And if these space rocks are magnetic...

622
00:38:19,573 --> 00:38:20,699
so is that.

623
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,377
This can only mean one thing.

624
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:27,423
And that would be...

625
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,420
Allow me.

626
00:38:31,694 --> 00:38:33,059
Whoa!

627
00:38:33,134 --> 00:38:34,374
Where are we?

628
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:36,582
You are in my brain.

629
00:38:37,894 --> 00:38:39,055
Hmm. Kind of chilly.

630
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:41,615
Gentlemen, here's what we know.

631
00:38:41,774 --> 00:38:45,574
Space rocks? Magnetic.
Asteroid? Also, magnetic.

632
00:38:45,774 --> 00:38:49,142
Famed astrophysicist Neil deBuck Weasel!

633
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:50,625
He knows the cosmos.

634
00:38:50,774 --> 00:38:53,095
Ipso facto, thusly and ergo...

635
00:38:53,254 --> 00:38:55,222
the crash site must have
a heap of these things

636
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,938
attracting the asteroid.

637
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,734
Ooh. Pythagoras Buck.
He's got the right angle.

638
00:38:59,894 --> 00:39:02,740
What if we use the magnets to attract
the asteroids somewhere else?

639
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,579
As in, not towards Earth.

640
00:39:04,735 --> 00:39:08,776
Theoretically speaking, if we can
launch enough of these into space...

641
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:11,342
they will pull the asteroid off course.

642
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:14,258
Thus, saving the world.

643
00:39:17,095 --> 00:39:19,097
So, we just need to
go to the crash site...

644
00:39:19,255 --> 00:39:21,576
and launch a bunch of rocks into space.

645
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:22,776
That's easy, right?

646
00:39:22,935 --> 00:39:25,620
Oh, yeah. Sounds like
a real piece of cake.

647
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:27,265
This is progress!

648
00:39:27,415 --> 00:39:29,702
Now we know exactly
what we don't know how to do.

649
00:39:30,975 --> 00:39:32,500
Vamanos, mammals!

650
00:39:32,655 --> 00:39:35,386
This trail will take us
directly to the crash site.

651
00:39:38,096 --> 00:39:39,507
All right, kids.

652
00:39:39,616 --> 00:39:41,380
Let's have some fun.

653
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,379
Oh!

654
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,778
Okay, everyone. Follow the trail.

655
00:39:46,936 --> 00:39:49,018
Never leave the trail.

656
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:51,138
Hmm?

657
00:39:57,056 --> 00:39:59,024
Okay, everyone. Leave the trail.

658
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:00,621
Into the forest. Chop, chop.

659
00:40:00,816 --> 00:40:02,818
But you just said...

660
00:40:02,896 --> 00:40:05,467
You know I'm crazy. Come on.

661
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,378
I love the shade. Don't you?

662
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:22,662
Well played, weasel.

663
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:23,978
Stay sharp, kids.

664
00:40:24,177 --> 00:40:26,179
They can't hide forever.

665
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:39,144
Hey, Buck.

666
00:40:39,217 --> 00:40:41,743
You have a suggestion
for getting around the river?

667
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,060
Let's see if the tablet's
ancient wisdom will guide us.

668
00:40:45,377 --> 00:40:46,378
Hmm.

669
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,379
Hmm.

670
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,858
Let my mammals pass!

671
00:41:13,058 --> 00:41:14,628
That's never gonna work.

672
00:41:21,818 --> 00:41:24,629
The ancients grant us safe passage.

673
00:41:24,939 --> 00:41:26,987
Sweet!

674
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:54,500
Wow, the air feels strange.

675
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:56,344
Uh...

676
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:57,580
Diego?

677
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,941
Hmm...

678
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,781
What?

679
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,263
Finally! We have superpowers!

680
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,941
Ladies and gentlemen,

681
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,864
we have wandered into an electrical storm.

682
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,620
I suggest we all stay away from the trees.

683
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,382
Sure, no problem.

684
00:42:34,461 --> 00:42:35,826
It's not like we're in a forest.

685
00:42:41,381 --> 00:42:44,510
Boy, Mother Nature sure
is in a bad mood lately.

686
00:42:44,661 --> 00:42:47,141
Good thing we're all here
to help each other.

687
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:50,669
Oh, like I always say,
stay close, stay alive.

688
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,188
There they are!

689
00:42:58,301 --> 00:43:00,827
Right out in the open.

690
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:02,551
How stupid can you be?

691
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:04,863
Come on, kids. Dive!

692
00:43:11,262 --> 00:43:15,062
Everyone, try not to create
any sort of friction.

693
00:43:15,222 --> 00:43:17,065
No friction. Got it.

694
00:43:17,222 --> 00:43:19,031
Yup. Cool beans.

695
00:43:19,182 --> 00:43:20,832
Friction is what now?

696
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:23,513
Oh, no.

697
00:43:33,262 --> 00:43:35,071
Come on! Let's get out of here.

698
00:43:42,422 --> 00:43:43,662
Hurry, Granny.

699
00:43:43,742 --> 00:43:44,868
Don't you hurry me.

700
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,390
I've been struck by
lightning more times...

701
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:48,954
Ahh! Granny!

702
00:43:49,383 --> 00:43:51,431
...than you've had hot breakfasts.

703
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,584
Peaches!

704
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,945
Julian, don't move!

705
00:44:02,063 --> 00:44:03,064
Oh!

706
00:44:04,623 --> 00:44:05,988
I have an idea.

707
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:08,713
I'm coming, sweetheart!

708
00:44:09,383 --> 00:44:11,112
Julian, why aren't you helping her?

709
00:44:11,223 --> 00:44:13,191
Wait! No, Manny, she...

710
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,073
Uh, what are you guys doing?

711
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,270
Helping?

712
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:22,074
What would "not helping" look like?

713
00:44:23,584 --> 00:44:25,029
Hey, zapheads!

714
00:44:25,104 --> 00:44:26,105
Whoo!

715
00:44:32,424 --> 00:44:34,472
Manny, get ready to run.

716
00:44:36,264 --> 00:44:37,948
Come on, let's go!

717
00:44:49,784 --> 00:44:50,945
Everybody make it?

718
00:44:51,104 --> 00:44:53,027
Shira, Manny, Crash, Eddie, Ellie, Granny.

719
00:44:53,184 --> 00:44:55,027
Aw, shoot! I'm out of fingers.

720
00:44:55,184 --> 00:44:56,869
Buck. Where's Buck?

721
00:44:59,625 --> 00:45:00,706
Do you hear that?

722
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:03,312
A baby!

723
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:05,468
There's a baby in there!

724
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:08,112
Buck, wait! It's too dangerous.

725
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:15,471
He's gone.

726
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:17,150
I can't believe it.

727
00:45:17,305 --> 00:45:20,149
Don't know how we'll
go on without you, Buck.

728
00:45:20,945 --> 00:45:22,629
All right, let's go.

729
00:45:25,145 --> 00:45:26,306
It's Buck!

730
00:45:30,905 --> 00:45:32,317
Huh?

731
00:45:32,826 --> 00:45:35,636
I got you. Don't worry, I got you.

732
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:37,988
There you are. There.

733
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:39,307
Say "hi," everyone.

734
00:45:39,386 --> 00:45:40,512
Huh?

735
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:42,995
Isn't she gorgeous?

736
00:45:43,186 --> 00:45:44,995
How can he tell it's a she?

737
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,073
Oh.

738
00:45:47,146 --> 00:45:49,513
Such a good little poochie-woochie.

739
00:45:51,506 --> 00:45:54,032
Just to be clear, that's a pumpkin, right?

740
00:45:54,706 --> 00:45:57,835
She has a little jaundice,
but I think she'll be okay.

741
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:59,750
Yes, you will.

742
00:45:59,906 --> 00:46:03,672
I think I'll call you... Bronwyn.

743
00:46:04,106 --> 00:46:06,393
Um, little buddy?
We need you back on planet Earth.

744
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:08,754
While it's still here. Okay?

745
00:46:08,947 --> 00:46:10,108
Right you are, mammal.

746
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,874
Who wants to save the world
from the fiery asteroid?

747
00:46:13,947 --> 00:46:14,948
You do!

748
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:17,708
Hmm.

749
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:34,388
Mmm...

750
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:36,469
Okay, mammals.
Let's stop here for the night.

751
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:40,231
Stop? What about the whole
end of the world collision thing?

752
00:46:40,387 --> 00:46:42,310
Oh, asteroid's still a day off.

753
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,914
And like my grandfather used to say...

754
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:47,873
"Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

755
00:46:48,068 --> 00:46:51,151
"Purple sky at night,
who moved my foot cream?

756
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,231
"I need my foot cream."

757
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:55,994
Grampy was a confused and angry weasel.

758
00:46:57,908 --> 00:46:59,069
You are so funny, J.

759
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,473
Stop! You're funny.

760
00:47:01,668 --> 00:47:04,114
Take it easy, my brother
from a tiger mother.

761
00:47:06,588 --> 00:47:08,511
Hasta manana, J-man.

762
00:47:09,068 --> 00:47:10,479
What was that?

763
00:47:10,628 --> 00:47:11,834
What was what?

764
00:47:13,788 --> 00:47:15,631
Oh, that! It's a cool way to peace out.

765
00:47:15,748 --> 00:47:16,829
Julian taught it to me.

766
00:47:16,988 --> 00:47:19,310
Well, I'm glad the apocalypse
is bringing you together.

767
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,915
He's a good kid, Manny.
I like his philosophy.

768
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:23,912
Give him a chance. Bond with him.

769
00:47:24,589 --> 00:47:26,239
So light 'em up, up, up

770
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:27,595
Light 'em up, up, up

771
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:31,674
Light 'em up, up, up, I'm on fire

772
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:34,760
Bonding! That's a good idea!

773
00:47:35,149 --> 00:47:37,436
Oh, right. Got you.

774
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:40,638
You take Julian.
I got an idea for Peaches.

775
00:47:43,669 --> 00:47:45,797
Hey, Bro-Kid.

776
00:47:45,949 --> 00:47:48,236
Oh, hey, Bro-Dad. You here to rock out?

777
00:47:49,989 --> 00:47:51,514
Okay. Instead of that...

778
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:54,112
how about a game before bedtime?

779
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:57,831
No way! You want to play
a game with me? Wow!

780
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:00,721
What is honored times 1,000?

781
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,395
No! Times one million?

782
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,157
'Cause whatever that equals,
is how honored I am.

783
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:08,392
So, is that a "yes"?

784
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:11,156
Yes, that's a "yes." It's the most "yes"!

785
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,153
It's like "yes" with a bunch of s's...

786
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,519
so it's like "yes."

787
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:17,910
Great!

788
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,152
I'll see you on the ice!

789
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:25,037
Happy?

790
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,036
Whoa!

791
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:34,437
Oh, boy.

792
00:48:42,351 --> 00:48:45,002
So, do you think you're ready
to go out roaming on your own?

793
00:48:45,191 --> 00:48:47,353
I won't be alone. I'll have Julian.

794
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:50,082
Sure. But with asteroids flying...

795
00:48:50,231 --> 00:48:51,562
no home to speak of

796
00:48:51,671 --> 00:48:53,594
and absolutely no support system...

797
00:48:53,751 --> 00:48:55,241
do you think you'll be ready for...

798
00:48:55,351 --> 00:48:56,352
this?

799
00:48:57,871 --> 00:48:59,873
I'm a wittle baby.

800
00:49:01,231 --> 00:49:03,598
Imagine. You're in the woods,
looking for food...

801
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,113
and your baby gets sick. What do you do?

802
00:49:06,192 --> 00:49:07,353
Uh...

803
00:49:07,432 --> 00:49:09,594
No! Jiggling makes her feel worse!

804
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,161
Oh, no! Now your older toddler

805
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:18,712
has a skinned knee and a stuffy nose.

806
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:20,552
Mommy, hold me!

807
00:49:20,712 --> 00:49:22,043
Now your babies are crying.

808
00:49:22,192 --> 00:49:24,115
You have no food and then

809
00:49:24,232 --> 00:49:26,917
you come face to face with a rabid beast!

810
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:33,235
I am a rabid beast
who gives rabies to babies.

811
00:49:34,872 --> 00:49:37,113
And there's an arsonist on the loose.

812
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,600
How are you going to handle
all this without our help?

813
00:49:55,753 --> 00:49:57,676
- Huh?
- Ah!

814
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:03,719
Ah!

815
00:50:05,593 --> 00:50:06,958
Peaches, out!

816
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,044
That's just the easy stuff.

817
00:50:13,193 --> 00:50:15,514
There's a lot more we still need to cover.

818
00:50:16,994 --> 00:50:19,361
Uh... Baby made a poopie.

819
00:50:19,594 --> 00:50:24,316
I'm a method actor,
so I will need to be changed.

820
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:26,964
Oh! So close!

821
00:50:27,114 --> 00:50:29,162
These pucks go fast.

822
00:50:29,314 --> 00:50:32,204
Just watch the puck
all the way into the stick.

823
00:50:35,954 --> 00:50:37,558
Oh! I did it!

824
00:50:37,714 --> 00:50:39,796
Too bad you and Peaches are moving away.

825
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:42,161
If you stayed,
we could do this all the time.

826
00:50:42,354 --> 00:50:44,800
Okay. Show me the heat!

827
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:46,797
I'm like a hockey ninja!

828
00:50:50,034 --> 00:50:51,399
Hey, Peaches!

829
00:50:51,554 --> 00:50:53,364
Looks like you got a new hockey partner

830
00:50:53,475 --> 00:50:54,886
to replace your dad.

831
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:01,316
Oh!

832
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,726
Oh, no.

833
00:51:06,915 --> 00:51:08,405
Julian!

834
00:51:11,315 --> 00:51:13,682
Such a mystery why he wants
to move far away.

835
00:51:13,835 --> 00:51:15,200
I didn't mean to do it.

836
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,517
It's not my fault the kid has no reflexes.

837
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:18,881
How could you do that to him?

838
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,321
I thought you liked Julian.

839
00:51:20,515 --> 00:51:21,516
I do like Julian.

840
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:22,836
Well, you don't act like it.

841
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:25,441
When you look at him,
all you see is an obstacle.

842
00:51:25,595 --> 00:51:27,165
Or worse, a target.

843
00:51:27,355 --> 00:51:29,165
But I see a sweet guy...

844
00:51:29,356 --> 00:51:32,280
who's trying his hardest to impress you.

845
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:34,518
- Peaches.
- No! Both of you, just stop!

846
00:51:34,676 --> 00:51:36,519
If we survive, I'm still getting married

847
00:51:36,596 --> 00:51:37,836
and I'm still leaving home.

848
00:51:38,036 --> 00:51:40,403
Whether you're happy for me or not.

849
00:51:43,596 --> 00:51:45,564
Don't give me that look. She said both.

850
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:47,559
That means you, too.

851
00:51:49,876 --> 00:51:51,685
And this widdle astewoid

852
00:51:51,756 --> 00:51:53,918
went wee, wee, wee, all the way home.

853
00:51:55,436 --> 00:51:56,881
Hey...

854
00:51:57,956 --> 00:51:59,003
Eh...

855
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:02,797
Because Daddy and his fwiends
saved the world.

856
00:52:13,077 --> 00:52:16,638
And if that pterodactyl don't fly

857
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:20,165
Daddy's gonna blind his remaining eye

858
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:27,239
Sweet dreams, little one.

859
00:52:28,237 --> 00:52:30,558
Lucky pumpkin!

860
00:52:30,637 --> 00:52:32,844
It must be nice to have a loving father.

861
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:33,964
Whoo.

862
00:52:34,077 --> 00:52:36,921
Okay, here we go. You can do this, Roger.

863
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,128
Yay! Kidnapping!

864
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:43,681
Look I'm sorry. It's not me.

865
00:52:43,758 --> 00:52:44,919
I would never do something like this.

866
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,445
It's my father. He's crazy.

867
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,680
I can't believe he pulled it off!

868
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:51,488
Way to go, dum-dum!

869
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:52,969
Oh. Thanks, Dad.

870
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:55,359
Whatever! I could've done the same thing.

871
00:52:58,118 --> 00:52:59,608
Well, well.

872
00:52:59,758 --> 00:53:02,409
Looks like you're not
stopping that asteroid now,

873
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:03,684
are you, weasel?

874
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,599
Huh?

875
00:53:05,678 --> 00:53:06,679
That's not the weasel. That's...

876
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:09,960
- I don't know what that is.
- Hmm.

877
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:11,319
Whoa!

878
00:53:13,598 --> 00:53:15,328
Is it my time, angel?

879
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,125
Time for what?

880
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:19,329
I'm coming to the light.

881
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:22,802
Can't wait to see all those
dead relatives I hate.

882
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,967
Ahh! Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!

883
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:26,730
Go help your sister.

884
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:27,960
But, Dad...

885
00:53:28,479 --> 00:53:29,969
Ahh! Demon angel!

886
00:53:32,479 --> 00:53:35,050
Mess with Granny,
get knocked on your fanny.

887
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:42,481
And that's how it's done. Hmm.

888
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,005
Hello? Angel?

889
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:46,320
Am I in heaven?

890
00:53:46,479 --> 00:53:48,561
It's so dark and squishy in here.

891
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:49,686
Huh?

892
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:52,446
Oh, no! I can still see the light.

893
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:55,921
Ow!

894
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:01,208
Pop! I'll save you.

895
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,168
Whee!

896
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:08,601
Hello!

897
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,569
Oh, well. Probably for the best.

898
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,085
- Yeah, probably.
- Definitely.

899
00:54:29,401 --> 00:54:30,402
Crikey!

900
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:33,884
Mmm.

901
00:54:33,961 --> 00:54:36,805
Good gravy, Buck. What have you done?

902
00:54:36,961 --> 00:54:38,963
All right, mammals. Time to get moving.

903
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,408
Now let's not linger on this, but, yes...

904
00:54:41,601 --> 00:54:44,810
I read the tablet wrong.
The asteroid is a lot closer.

905
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:49,642
Uh-oh.

906
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:51,485
Wait a second. Where's Granny?

907
00:54:51,761 --> 00:54:54,605
- Oh.
- Granny? Oh, Granny?

908
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:56,092
Maybe she wandered off?

909
00:54:56,281 --> 00:54:58,045
Maybe she got hit in the head with a puck?

910
00:54:58,241 --> 00:54:59,731
Yes! And maybe she was abducted

911
00:54:59,801 --> 00:55:01,485
by homicidal 30-foot dino-birds...

912
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:03,087
seeking revenge on me.

913
00:55:03,242 --> 00:55:06,246
All good theories.
I'm going to go with the puck.

914
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:08,813
I knew it!

915
00:55:09,082 --> 00:55:12,086
So this whole time we've been
chased by giant dino-birds?

916
00:55:12,402 --> 00:55:15,406
Oh, only three!
I didn't want to damage morale.

917
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,688
Right. Because before this,

918
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:18,645
we were on a carefree pleasure cruise.

919
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:20,332
Wait a second.

920
00:55:20,402 --> 00:55:22,769
I've got her scent. Come on!

921
00:55:31,922 --> 00:55:32,923
Whoa!

922
00:55:34,922 --> 00:55:37,654
Mammals, we've made it!

923
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:39,373
The crash site.

924
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:41,969
This must be what's left
of the previous asteroid.

925
00:55:42,643 --> 00:55:45,772
Uh, Buck? Your space rocks!

926
00:55:47,803 --> 00:55:49,646
We could definitely divert the asteroid

927
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,003
with a magnet that size!

928
00:55:51,163 --> 00:55:52,767
I mean that thing is enormous.

929
00:55:52,963 --> 00:55:54,169
It's massive, it's...

930
00:55:54,323 --> 00:55:56,610
...going to be impossible
to get off the ground.

931
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:58,168
It's entirely possible.

932
00:55:58,323 --> 00:56:01,008
In a way that we don't know about yet.

933
00:56:01,163 --> 00:56:02,813
But what about the dino-birds?

934
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,806
And what about Granny?

935
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:07,454
Nothing.

936
00:56:08,363 --> 00:56:09,569
I'm sorry, Sid.

937
00:56:10,683 --> 00:56:15,167
Oh, Granny. My sweet, malicious Granny.

938
00:56:15,524 --> 00:56:18,812
Why does it always have to be
the old ones who go first?

939
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:20,045
Why?

940
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:25,568
I can still hear her
sweet, shrill voice...

941
00:56:25,724 --> 00:56:27,852
shrieking from the afterlife.

942
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:30,885
Granny's alive!

943
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:32,165
And she's in trouble!

944
00:56:40,124 --> 00:56:41,489
Granny?

945
00:56:41,644 --> 00:56:43,487
- Granny?
- Granny?

946
00:56:55,165 --> 00:56:56,496
Is she okay?

947
00:56:56,725 --> 00:56:58,534
Uh, I'm not sure.

948
00:57:03,205 --> 00:57:04,730
Unhand my Granny!

949
00:57:04,885 --> 00:57:06,808
You do and you don't get a tip.

950
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,774
Making this beautiful sloth happy

951
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,529
is all the payment I need.

952
00:57:10,685 --> 00:57:13,211
You see? Hunky bunny gets it.

953
00:57:13,365 --> 00:57:14,526
Granny!

954
00:57:14,685 --> 00:57:17,450
There's a bunny living in the asteroid?

955
00:57:17,525 --> 00:57:18,890
Did not see that coming.

956
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:21,366
Wait till you see this!

957
00:57:28,726 --> 00:57:29,727
Oh!

958
00:57:30,726 --> 00:57:32,854
Whoo-hoo!

959
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,052
Yeah!

960
00:57:34,206 --> 00:57:36,368
Catching mad air on the half-pipe!

961
00:57:36,566 --> 00:57:37,772
This is crazy.

962
00:57:38,006 --> 00:57:39,132
Do you think they know

963
00:57:39,206 --> 00:57:41,049
they are living in a magnetic bull's-eye?

964
00:57:41,206 --> 00:57:42,287
Doesn't look like a lot of

965
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,170
doomsday prepping going on in here.

966
00:57:44,366 --> 00:57:45,572
I can't believe it!

967
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:46,852
Visitors!

968
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:49,577
We've never had visitors.

969
00:57:49,686 --> 00:57:52,417
Somebody pinch me. Or should I pinch you?

970
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:53,772
Wait, I'll pinch both of us.

971
00:57:55,086 --> 00:57:57,771
Did I hit my head? What's happening here?

972
00:57:58,566 --> 00:58:00,569
I sure hope this isn't a... Oh!

973
00:58:02,287 --> 00:58:04,210
dream!

974
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:08,453
Dream Weaver

975
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:11,730
I believe you can get me through the night

976
00:58:15,647 --> 00:58:17,775
This guy? For real?

977
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:19,816
Whatever.

978
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,130
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

979
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:24,776
Hello, handsome.

980
00:58:24,927 --> 00:58:26,292
I'm Brooke.

981
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,608
Ooh. Such exquisite bone structure.

982
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:32,456
Such a strong jaw.

983
00:58:32,607 --> 00:58:34,928
I'm getting butterflies!

984
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,732
I'm getting nauseous.

985
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:38,652
Sorry to interrupt this
weirdo love connection...

986
00:58:38,808 --> 00:58:40,298
but we're kind of in a hurry.

987
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:41,859
If we don't do something fast...

988
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:45,137
that asteroid is gonna
blow us all to smithereens.

989
00:58:46,248 --> 00:58:48,455
Oh. That sounds urgent.

990
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:50,292
I better take you to him.

991
00:58:50,448 --> 00:58:52,416
Who's "him"? Your leader?

992
00:58:52,608 --> 00:58:55,134
He is our everything.

993
00:58:55,288 --> 00:58:56,699
He sees all.

994
00:58:56,848 --> 00:58:58,088
He knows all.

995
00:58:58,248 --> 00:59:00,854
And smells amazing!

996
00:59:01,448 --> 00:59:03,655
Okay. He sounds great. Let's go!

997
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,776
Brilliant. Right this way.

998
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:13,416
Whoo-hoo!

999
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:14,490
Yes!

1000
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:19,657
Please keep your arms and legs

1001
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:22,170
inside the tram at all times.

1002
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:25,617
But allow your spirit to roam free...

1003
00:59:25,809 --> 00:59:28,016
in Geotopia.

1004
00:59:28,169 --> 00:59:30,137
I have a good feeling about this.

1005
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:31,734
Maybe he'll be able to help us.

1006
00:59:31,889 --> 00:59:33,459
She did say he knows all.

1007
00:59:33,649 --> 00:59:35,299
And all's a lot!

1008
00:59:39,689 --> 00:59:41,020
Here he is.

1009
00:59:41,169 --> 00:59:45,015
The Master of Meditation,
the Supreme Serene...

1010
00:59:45,169 --> 00:59:48,891
the four-time Heavy Thoughts
champion of the world!

1011
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:03,935
Is that a llama? I hate llamas.

1012
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,740
They spit and smell.

1013
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:06,931
So does she.

1014
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:08,774
So do we!

1015
01:00:16,050 --> 01:00:18,576
Oh!

1016
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,101
Greetings, mammals!

1017
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,256
The Shangri Llama will see you...

1018
01:00:26,411 --> 01:00:27,572
now.

1019
01:00:27,731 --> 01:00:28,778
Ooh. Wonderful.

1020
01:00:30,171 --> 01:00:31,297
So where is he?

1021
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:33,533
He is here. Talking to you.

1022
01:00:33,611 --> 01:00:36,455
Oh, I get it. He's a ventriloquist

1023
01:00:36,571 --> 01:00:37,777
and you're the dummy.

1024
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:39,900
- No, you're the dummy.
- No, you're the dummy.

1025
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:41,058
No, you're the dummy.

1026
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:42,417
This is the guy that's going to save us.

1027
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:43,857
Look within. You're the dummy.

1028
01:00:45,371 --> 01:00:47,373
Disgusting! Loved that!

1029
01:00:47,531 --> 01:00:50,102
New topic. We're all about to die.

1030
01:00:50,251 --> 01:00:53,221
Well, that's no good. Stress is a killer.

1031
01:00:53,371 --> 01:00:55,977
Let us loosen our limbs
and open our minds.

1032
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:57,417
Downward Dog!

1033
01:00:58,412 --> 01:00:59,777
Uh... Seriously?

1034
01:00:59,932 --> 01:01:02,936
I'll wait. I have all the
time in the world.

1035
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:08,335
Actually, you don't have
all the time in the world.

1036
01:01:08,492 --> 01:01:12,099
None of us do. You see,
there's this thing in the sky.

1037
01:01:12,292 --> 01:01:13,782
Oh. That blinding light

1038
01:01:13,892 --> 01:01:15,417
that seems to get larger by the minute?

1039
01:01:15,652 --> 01:01:17,734
What about it? Seems fine to me.

1040
01:01:18,452 --> 01:01:20,341
With all due respect, Your Twistiness,

1041
01:01:20,452 --> 01:01:21,613
that's an asteroid.

1042
01:01:21,772 --> 01:01:23,661
It's magnetically attracted to this place

1043
01:01:23,772 --> 01:01:25,501
and it's heading straight for us.

1044
01:01:25,612 --> 01:01:27,455
Aha!

1045
01:01:27,572 --> 01:01:29,779
It must desire our magnetic crystals.

1046
01:01:29,972 --> 01:01:31,212
Well, who can blame it?

1047
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,817
They're really quite something.

1048
01:01:32,972 --> 01:01:35,135
Did you know their power
grants eternal youth?

1049
01:01:35,293 --> 01:01:37,773
I am over 400 years old. Mmm-hmm.

1050
01:01:37,853 --> 01:01:39,457
- That's not possible.
- Sure it is.

1051
01:01:39,653 --> 01:01:42,418
I'm 326! Whoo!

1052
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:45,343
Huh? You don't look a day over 275.

1053
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:49,142
We are young, happy and safe.
And we always will be.

1054
01:01:49,293 --> 01:01:51,978
Thanks to Geotopia!

1055
01:01:52,133 --> 01:01:53,862
Kudos. It is lovely.

1056
01:01:54,013 --> 01:01:56,698
Now, let's figure out
a way to launch it into space!

1057
01:01:56,853 --> 01:01:59,015
I'm sorry. You want to destroy our home?

1058
01:01:59,213 --> 01:02:00,977
It'll be destroyed either way.

1059
01:02:01,173 --> 01:02:03,335
But if we propel this magnetic material

1060
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:04,534
into the atmosphere...

1061
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:07,503
we can change the asteroid's
path and save everyone.

1062
01:02:07,653 --> 01:02:09,065
What do you say?

1063
01:02:09,494 --> 01:02:10,495
Caterpillar!

1064
01:02:12,134 --> 01:02:14,978
So, is that a yes? Or...

1065
01:02:15,054 --> 01:02:16,055
Oh.

1066
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:18,700
You are storing a lot of hostility

1067
01:02:18,814 --> 01:02:19,861
in your lower spine.

1068
01:02:20,694 --> 01:02:21,855
Shangri Llama, how are we gonna...

1069
01:02:22,014 --> 01:02:24,699
Funky Chicken. Jiggy Jelly. Mashed Potato.

1070
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:27,141
Your flexibility is a sight to behold.

1071
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:28,455
Now how the devil

1072
01:02:28,534 --> 01:02:29,979
are we going to launch these crystals?

1073
01:02:30,134 --> 01:02:31,898
You can't. It's impossible.

1074
01:02:32,654 --> 01:02:34,497
Whoo! I am bushed.

1075
01:02:36,334 --> 01:02:37,540
Awesome meeting you guys.

1076
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:39,856
Feel free to hang or, you know, whatever.

1077
01:02:41,694 --> 01:02:42,741
Hmm.

1078
01:02:42,854 --> 01:02:45,540
That's it. He was our last hope.

1079
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:46,821
We're doomed.

1080
01:02:47,015 --> 01:02:49,256
Yeah. All we got was a free yoga class.

1081
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:51,986
On that subject...

1082
01:02:52,055 --> 01:02:53,580
could you help me, please?

1083
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:56,386
My nose is dangerously close to my butt.

1084
01:02:56,655 --> 01:02:59,340
Uh, Sid, why do you have two tails?

1085
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:01,145
I'm in here, too.

1086
01:03:07,895 --> 01:03:09,385
Hey, don't cry.

1087
01:03:09,575 --> 01:03:11,020
Look on the bright side.

1088
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:14,464
We get to see our lives
flash before our eyes.

1089
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:18,616
That means I get to
fall in love with you...

1090
01:03:18,775 --> 01:03:20,106
all over again.

1091
01:03:21,416 --> 01:03:23,418
Only you can make the end of the world

1092
01:03:23,536 --> 01:03:25,140
sound like a good thing.

1093
01:03:30,456 --> 01:03:32,538
We did a good job raising her.

1094
01:03:32,696 --> 01:03:34,300
She's stronger than we know.

1095
01:03:34,456 --> 01:03:37,938
Two days ago, I'd have given
anything to keep her with us.

1096
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:41,259
Now I'd give anything
just to see her get married,

1097
01:03:41,376 --> 01:03:42,901
and leave home.

1098
01:03:43,056 --> 01:03:45,946
Play with her kids,
dance with her husband.

1099
01:03:46,096 --> 01:03:48,383
Yell at him when he forgets
their anniversary.

1100
01:03:51,056 --> 01:03:52,626
It was a good one, wasn't it?

1101
01:03:53,256 --> 01:03:56,261
Our life? You, me, and Peaches.

1102
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,822
The best.

1103
01:04:02,657 --> 01:04:04,307
Oh, Brooke.

1104
01:04:04,457 --> 01:04:05,982
You're so pretty.

1105
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:08,464
You take my lisp away.

1106
01:04:08,937 --> 01:04:11,463
I bet you say that to all the girls.

1107
01:04:11,617 --> 01:04:14,541
I try. But usually they run away too fast.

1108
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,139
Oh, you're such a romantic.

1109
01:04:18,937 --> 01:04:21,781
Hey, I know this is going to
sound super forward...

1110
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,146
but will you be my mate for life?

1111
01:04:25,337 --> 01:04:27,943
Oh, Brooke, I don't know what to say.

1112
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,020
It's only been twelve minutes.

1113
01:04:30,177 --> 01:04:31,862
What took you so long?

1114
01:04:32,018 --> 01:04:33,622
Yes! This has been

1115
01:04:33,698 --> 01:04:36,178
the best last day on Earth ever.

1116
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,227
A diamond! I need a diamond!

1117
01:04:38,338 --> 01:04:39,464
Where can I find a...

1118
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:41,507
Oh! Perfect.

1119
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:45,384
No, no, no. Sid, sweetie, don't do that.

1120
01:04:45,538 --> 01:04:51,227
Nonsense. Only the best
for my one... true... love.

1121
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,859
Whoopsies!

1122
01:05:04,938 --> 01:05:06,144
No, no, no!

1123
01:05:06,218 --> 01:05:09,189
Oaf! Simpleton! Nincompoop!

1124
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:10,909
You talking to her or me?

1125
01:05:11,459 --> 01:05:13,860
That wall was the one thing
keeping us young.

1126
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:17,819
Now we're all doomed! Doomed!

1127
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:20,470
And now, I think I have a fever.

1128
01:05:20,539 --> 01:05:22,268
Thank you so much, doofus!

1129
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:24,342
Hey! Easy there, Llama!

1130
01:05:24,499 --> 01:05:26,183
This is the doofus of my dreams.

1131
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:27,340
He meant well.

1132
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:28,660
Oh, he meant well.

1133
01:05:28,819 --> 01:05:30,583
Who cares?

1134
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:31,746
So much for serenity.

1135
01:05:31,899 --> 01:05:34,106
300 years of peace and harmony...

1136
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:38,423
undone by one colossally, incredibly...

1137
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,549
stupendously stupid sloth!

1138
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:54,226
Oh, Brooke.

1139
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,462
Wow! You guys got old.

1140
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,622
Whatever we had, it's over.

1141
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:01,260
That's what happens when you
date a cougar.

1142
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:03,622
I'm really sorry, Mr. Llama.

1143
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:06,391
Sorry. Sorry?

1144
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:07,825
Sorry doesn't fix the wall now,

1145
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:09,061
does it, you little...

1146
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,909
I need a bubble bath or a massage.

1147
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,266
Who knows acupuncture?

1148
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:17,310
I need to let my anger out. Let it out!

1149
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,782
I've been pent up too long.

1150
01:06:21,581 --> 01:06:24,061
I want to hit something.
Someone give me their face.

1151
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:27,232
That's it! Pent-up energy.

1152
01:06:27,381 --> 01:06:29,145
Earth's most powerful propulsion device

1153
01:06:29,261 --> 01:06:30,626
is right in front of us.

1154
01:06:30,781 --> 01:06:32,909
Who? Spitty McGee here?

1155
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:36,152
The volcano!

1156
01:06:36,301 --> 01:06:38,110
That's our magnet launcher.

1157
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:41,112
All we need to do is seal
the steam vents around it.

1158
01:06:42,621 --> 01:06:43,622
That's a crazy plan!

1159
01:06:43,701 --> 01:06:44,782
You're a crazy plan.

1160
01:06:44,941 --> 01:06:46,466
That doesn't even make any sense.

1161
01:06:46,581 --> 01:06:48,106
And what are you? A professor of logic?

1162
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:51,152
Professor Kitty McWhiskers of the
University of Meow Meow Meow Meow...

1163
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,071
You see? Tremendous pressure

1164
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:56,144
leads to a tremendous explosion.

1165
01:06:57,022 --> 01:06:59,184
And you call yourself a professor.

1166
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:01,586
Right. We need all the crystals

1167
01:07:01,662 --> 01:07:03,152
loaded into the volcano, pronto.

1168
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:04,463
What? No!

1169
01:07:04,622 --> 01:07:06,147
I'm not giving you my crystals.

1170
01:07:06,262 --> 01:07:09,072
We need them to rebuild our sanctuary.

1171
01:07:11,182 --> 01:07:15,028
May I remind you
Geotopia is not yours to keep.

1172
01:07:15,182 --> 01:07:16,183
No, you may not.

1173
01:07:16,262 --> 01:07:18,026
It came from the sky,

1174
01:07:18,142 --> 01:07:19,906
and now it's time to give it back.

1175
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:20,949
Is not!

1176
01:07:21,022 --> 01:07:22,672
Is too, you old coot.

1177
01:07:22,822 --> 01:07:25,348
Change isn't easy, but it's part of life.

1178
01:07:25,502 --> 01:07:27,709
It's time for us to embrace it again.

1179
01:07:27,862 --> 01:07:29,865
Whether you like it or not.

1180
01:07:30,023 --> 01:07:31,024
Not!

1181
01:07:31,223 --> 01:07:34,545
Listen, Llama, I will go
nuts and granola on your butt!

1182
01:07:34,703 --> 01:07:36,307
So either get on board...

1183
01:07:36,463 --> 01:07:38,545
or go twist yourself into a pretzel

1184
01:07:38,663 --> 01:07:40,392
and na-ma-stay out of our way.

1185
01:07:40,543 --> 01:07:41,954
Come on, everybody.

1186
01:07:42,023 --> 01:07:43,866
Grab every crystal you can find.

1187
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:45,832
Totally, let's do it!

1188
01:07:45,983 --> 01:07:48,509
And remember, lift with your legs.

1189
01:07:48,823 --> 01:07:50,393
Too late.

1190
01:07:53,183 --> 01:07:55,026
Listen up, planetary defense team.

1191
01:07:55,183 --> 01:07:57,470
Step one, build pressure

1192
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,904
inside the volcano by sealing the vents.

1193
01:08:00,863 --> 01:08:01,864
No steam can escape.

1194
01:08:02,023 --> 01:08:03,149
If there's a leak...

1195
01:08:03,303 --> 01:08:05,306
the pressure is weak.

1196
01:08:10,384 --> 01:08:13,672
Step two, get the biggest
magnetic crystals

1197
01:08:13,744 --> 01:08:14,870
into the volcano.

1198
01:08:15,024 --> 01:08:16,947
They've got to be launched sky high

1199
01:08:17,024 --> 01:08:18,833
to pull the asteroid off course.

1200
01:08:22,824 --> 01:08:24,553
- Heave!
- Ho!

1201
01:08:24,704 --> 01:08:26,433
- Heave!
- Ho!

1202
01:08:26,584 --> 01:08:28,393
Rah rah! Sis boom bah!

1203
01:08:28,544 --> 01:08:30,546
Tell that asteroid "Uh-uh."

1204
01:08:30,904 --> 01:08:31,905
- Whoo!
- #Asteroid!

1205
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,065
#WhatDoesHashTagMean?

1206
01:08:33,224 --> 01:08:34,749
#IDon'tKnowButItSoundsCool!

1207
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:35,905
#Totally!

1208
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,514
#I'mStartingToGetSickOfIt!

1209
01:08:40,224 --> 01:08:42,626
This is it, friends. Down the hatch.

1210
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,275
Every crystal counts.

1211
01:08:55,065 --> 01:08:56,351
Good news, everyone!

1212
01:08:56,425 --> 01:08:58,314
We're six minutes ahead of schedule.

1213
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:01,388
Somebody up there likes us.

1214
01:09:26,226 --> 01:09:28,957
Bad news! Somebody up there
doesn't like us.

1215
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:31,347
We're six minutes behind schedule!

1216
01:09:32,506 --> 01:09:35,430
Double time, everyone.
We need that big crystal.

1217
01:09:41,626 --> 01:09:42,832
Oh. Hey, Bro-Dad!

1218
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:57,113
We got company!

1219
01:09:57,267 --> 01:09:59,315
Ooh. I'll put out the sponge cake.

1220
01:10:05,787 --> 01:10:07,312
Steady.

1221
01:10:07,507 --> 01:10:09,714
Steady.

1222
01:10:11,507 --> 01:10:12,838
Sorry about this.

1223
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,790
I'm really conflicted right now.

1224
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:20,989
That's more like it, Roger.
Now finish him.

1225
01:10:21,187 --> 01:10:22,791
Wait! Wait, you don't understand.

1226
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:24,392
You see that?

1227
01:10:24,507 --> 01:10:26,509
If that asteroid hits, we all die.

1228
01:10:26,667 --> 01:10:28,238
If it hits, we all die.

1229
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:32,158
That's where you're wrong.

1230
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,356
See, while you run
for your mammal lives...

1231
01:10:34,508 --> 01:10:38,832
we'll be high in the sky,
cruising above it all.

1232
01:10:39,908 --> 01:10:43,037
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard!

1233
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:46,399
We'll be as safe as those little birdies.

1234
01:10:47,028 --> 01:10:48,871
Lucky shot.

1235
01:10:50,348 --> 01:10:52,157
Very lucky shot?

1236
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:57,390
I knew it. I was right.
There's no paradise.

1237
01:10:57,548 --> 01:11:01,269
What? I'm too young to go extinct!

1238
01:11:01,388 --> 01:11:04,996
She gets it! Now, please,
we haven't got much time!

1239
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:08,196
What are you waiting for? Kill him!

1240
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:10,829
No, Dad. I won't let you.

1241
01:11:11,029 --> 01:11:13,270
Do you want to know
what I love about our family?

1242
01:11:13,429 --> 01:11:15,193
That we're alive.

1243
01:11:15,349 --> 01:11:16,510
There are more important things

1244
01:11:16,589 --> 01:11:18,079
than your pride right now.

1245
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:19,879
If you care about us...

1246
01:11:20,029 --> 01:11:21,793
you should not kill him.

1247
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:23,917
You should help him, Dad.

1248
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:26,276
Pop, I hate to say this,

1249
01:11:26,389 --> 01:11:28,551
but my freaky little brother may be right.

1250
01:11:28,709 --> 01:11:32,191
As a father, I would
work with my worst enemy...

1251
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:36,075
to ensure a brighter future
for my little one.

1252
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:46,237
Reinforcements have arrived!

1253
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:56,959
All right, Roger. Lead the way.

1254
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,960
Oh! So that's what approval sounds like.

1255
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,075
Keep it up, dinos.

1256
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,073
Use that Jurassic super strength!

1257
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:14,676
Beep, beep, beep.

1258
01:12:23,271 --> 01:12:24,761
Watch out, kids!

1259
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:36,877
The weasel has landed.

1260
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:40,637
I'll push it in.
Go with Peaches and Ellie!

1261
01:12:42,311 --> 01:12:44,313
No!

1262
01:12:44,471 --> 01:12:47,042
I'm not leaving you!
We'll do this together!

1263
01:12:52,512 --> 01:12:54,002
Mom, where are they?

1264
01:12:55,512 --> 01:12:59,153
Ellie, we've got to get
everyone off the volcano.

1265
01:12:59,352 --> 01:13:01,798
Folks, I'm outta cake, but I got salami!

1266
01:13:01,952 --> 01:13:02,953
Faster, faster!

1267
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:04,193
I'mouttacakebutIgotsalami!

1268
01:13:04,352 --> 01:13:05,353
- Granny, come on!
- Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1269
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,514
This isn't working.

1270
01:13:18,072 --> 01:13:20,040
Mad air on the half-pipe!

1271
01:13:20,192 --> 01:13:22,160
Manny, I have a plan!

1272
01:13:22,312 --> 01:13:24,155
We have to let the crystal go!

1273
01:13:24,312 --> 01:13:26,759
You know we're trying to
get it in the volcano, right?

1274
01:13:26,913 --> 01:13:30,713
Manny, the only thing I want
is a life with Peaches.

1275
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,557
And to prove myself to you.

1276
01:13:32,713 --> 01:13:35,364
So, okay, two things. I want two things.

1277
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:38,762
Do you really think I'd waste
the only chance I have left?

1278
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,203
Okay, let's do it!

1279
01:13:43,393 --> 01:13:45,555
On my count. One...

1280
01:13:45,713 --> 01:13:46,714
Two...

1281
01:13:47,073 --> 01:13:48,723
Three!

1282
01:13:59,953 --> 01:14:01,877
What are they doing?

1283
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:20,604
Did it work?

1284
01:14:27,074 --> 01:14:30,601
Yes! I take back everything
I ever said about you!

1285
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:32,518
Wait, what?

1286
01:14:32,594 --> 01:14:33,595
Huh?

1287
01:14:36,274 --> 01:14:37,765
Now let's get out of here!

1288
01:15:00,675 --> 01:15:01,801
What happened?

1289
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:04,526
Maybe it's the quiet before the crazy?

1290
01:15:05,075 --> 01:15:06,315
Hmm.

1291
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,037
Eddie!

1292
01:15:34,156 --> 01:15:35,601
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

1293
01:15:59,797 --> 01:16:02,198
We did it. We did it!

1294
01:16:06,477 --> 01:16:08,081
In your face, space rock!

1295
01:16:08,237 --> 01:16:10,399
Yeah, baby!

1296
01:16:10,637 --> 01:16:12,321
Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Oh!

1297
01:16:14,477 --> 01:16:15,478
Hmm.

1298
01:16:15,557 --> 01:16:17,446
Not on the lips, geezer!

1299
01:16:18,717 --> 01:16:19,957
Hit the road, you stupid rock

1300
01:16:20,037 --> 01:16:21,687
We just stopped the doomsday clock!

1301
01:16:22,917 --> 01:16:25,444
- Yes! Yeah! Whoa!
- All right!

1302
01:16:25,558 --> 01:16:28,562
Bring it in, Bro-Son.
Welcome to the family.

1303
01:16:33,038 --> 01:16:35,279
And you, you coconut!

1304
01:16:35,438 --> 01:16:37,440
I'll never doubt you again.

1305
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:39,885
See? Daddy's always right.

1306
01:16:40,078 --> 01:16:41,682
Remember that when you're older.

1307
01:16:48,398 --> 01:16:50,082
Are you sure you can't come with us?

1308
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,969
Oh, Sidney, I wish I could.

1309
01:16:53,438 --> 01:16:55,600
But we both know this is for the best.

1310
01:16:55,798 --> 01:16:58,199
You've got your whole life
in front of you.

1311
01:16:58,358 --> 01:17:01,249
Besides, I'll have Granny
to keep me company.

1312
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:03,242
You're staying, too?

1313
01:17:03,399 --> 01:17:06,403
Are you kidding? This place is great!

1314
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:10,120
Tonight's the big talent show,
and tomorrow, naked bingo!

1315
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:11,445
You coming, Gladys?

1316
01:17:11,559 --> 01:17:13,163
I ain't getting any younger! Whoo!

1317
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:16,726
What? I can't hear you!

1318
01:17:16,879 --> 01:17:19,041
- What? I can't hear you!
- What?

1319
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:21,970
You'll always be my one true love.

1320
01:17:22,799 --> 01:17:24,642
Here.

1321
01:17:24,799 --> 01:17:25,960
Wow!

1322
01:17:26,959 --> 01:17:28,006
Hold on.

1323
01:17:32,759 --> 01:17:34,761
It looks just like you.

1324
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:36,968
Now we'll be with each other forever.

1325
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,450
So long, handsome!

1326
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:44,926
Bye, Sidney!

1327
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:00,011
What you need is more fiber.

1328
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,281
He's right.

1329
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,165
Shangri Llama's back on top, baby!

1330
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:14,521
Ooh. Ah! Mmm.

1331
01:18:18,681 --> 01:18:19,682
Gladys?

1332
01:18:21,721 --> 01:18:24,372
Well, hello Teddy Bear!

1333
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:27,605
Mmm-hmm.

1334
01:18:27,681 --> 01:18:31,527
Hot tubbin' just got a whole lot hotter.

1335
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,805
Amazing! It's like some kind of

1336
01:18:33,881 --> 01:18:35,963
"Fountain of Never Getting Old!"

1337
01:18:36,681 --> 01:18:38,683
Well, we can workshop the name later.

1338
01:18:53,202 --> 01:18:55,011
Where's the bride?
Why don't I have the bride?

1339
01:18:55,162 --> 01:18:57,051
'Cause you're talking into a twig.

1340
01:18:57,202 --> 01:18:58,328
Mom, I can't talk. I'm at a wedding.

1341
01:18:58,402 --> 01:18:59,403
What do you mean you can't talk?

1342
01:18:59,522 --> 01:19:00,489
Who are you with?

1343
01:19:00,562 --> 01:19:02,246
Um, excuse me.

1344
01:19:02,402 --> 01:19:05,565
Is it true you helped save
the world from an asteroid?

1345
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:07,292
Um...

1346
01:19:07,362 --> 01:19:09,729
That's a very scary story.

1347
01:19:09,882 --> 01:19:11,168
You think you can handle it?

1348
01:19:11,322 --> 01:19:12,687
Yeah.

1349
01:19:12,842 --> 01:19:13,923
How scary?

1350
01:19:14,402 --> 01:19:15,403
- Well, we were... Oh!
- Oh!

1351
01:19:15,562 --> 01:19:16,768
Hi!

1352
01:19:16,922 --> 01:19:18,253
It was five minutes to midnight...

1353
01:19:18,402 --> 01:19:20,245
and we were up against volcanoes,

1354
01:19:20,362 --> 01:19:22,252
dino-birds, and the end of the world.

1355
01:19:22,403 --> 01:19:24,883
Oh, and the zombies!
Don't forget the zombies!

1356
01:19:25,083 --> 01:19:27,563
You know, we'd be great parents.

1357
01:19:28,563 --> 01:19:29,803
So I turn to Bigfoot, and I say,

1358
01:19:29,883 --> 01:19:31,089
"Listen, big guy..."

1359
01:19:32,403 --> 01:19:35,088
I don't know. I don't know!
What am I gonna do?

1360
01:19:35,243 --> 01:19:38,565
Sweetie, listen to me.
This is normal, okay?

1361
01:19:38,763 --> 01:19:41,209
- Everyone gets nervous.
- What's going on? What happened?

1362
01:19:41,363 --> 01:19:42,364
It's just...

1363
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:45,652
I can't go. How can I go?

1364
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:47,612
I don't wanna leave you guys.

1365
01:19:52,363 --> 01:19:54,252
Hey, Fuzzball...

1366
01:19:54,443 --> 01:19:56,605
remember the first time
that we played hockey?

1367
01:19:56,763 --> 01:19:58,448
You were so afraid to get on the ice

1368
01:19:58,564 --> 01:19:59,770
because it was slippery?

1369
01:20:01,284 --> 01:20:03,810
Remember how I held you up
while you started to skate?

1370
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:06,444
And when I knew you were ready,
I let you go.

1371
01:20:06,924 --> 01:20:09,245
Aw, Dad.

1372
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,567
I know you're ready.
Now you have to let go.

1373
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:15,170
I always knew it would take
someone very special

1374
01:20:15,284 --> 01:20:16,445
to match your spirit.

1375
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:19,448
And you found him. Just like I did.

1376
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:21,413
It's your time, sweetie.

1377
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,486
See the world, chase your dreams.

1378
01:20:24,404 --> 01:20:26,452
And whenever you decide to come back...

1379
01:20:26,924 --> 01:20:28,653
we'll be here, okay?

1380
01:20:38,805 --> 01:20:40,489
Okay.

1381
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:42,611
Oh.

1382
01:21:18,486 --> 01:21:19,692
Do you...

1383
01:21:19,846 --> 01:21:20,847
I do.

1384
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,053
And do you...

1385
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:23,697
Most def.

1386
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,689
I now pronounce you...

1387
01:21:43,886 --> 01:21:45,218
Sid!

1388
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,573
Brooke!

1389
01:21:56,047 --> 01:21:57,572
Oh! Whoa! Ow!

1390
01:21:57,687 --> 01:21:58,654
Oops!

1391
01:21:58,727 --> 01:22:00,217
This is amazing!

1392
01:22:00,407 --> 01:22:03,058
You're young again.
And somehow, I'm still single.

1393
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:05,687
I guess the universe was smiling on us.

1394
01:22:05,847 --> 01:22:07,576
I have so many questions for you.

1395
01:22:07,727 --> 01:22:09,729
What happened? How'd you find me?

1396
01:22:09,887 --> 01:22:11,218
Have you tried the shrimp?

1397
01:22:11,287 --> 01:22:13,608
Shh. Close that pretty
little mouth of yours

1398
01:22:13,727 --> 01:22:14,888
and just listen.

1399
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:19,408
This is dedicated to
the sloth of my dreams.

1400
01:22:19,888 --> 01:22:21,970
That guy? For real?

1401
01:22:22,128 --> 01:22:26,929
Oh, oh, Sid

1402
01:22:27,088 --> 01:22:28,931
Sid, baby

1403
01:22:29,568 --> 01:22:33,459
You make me so happy

1404
01:22:35,128 --> 01:22:37,256
Oh I never knew I would make it out

1405
01:22:37,408 --> 01:22:40,252
And come this far, oh I never knew I

1406
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:43,213
Would see the day we come together

1407
01:22:43,408 --> 01:22:45,615
Oh, it's not like anything I've ever

1408
01:22:45,728 --> 01:22:46,729
Whoa!

1409
01:22:52,168 --> 01:22:53,329
You

1410
01:22:53,488 --> 01:22:54,569
You make me happy

1411
01:22:55,288 --> 01:22:57,018
You keep me laughing

1412
01:22:57,169 --> 01:23:00,173
You make my world a better place

1413
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:01,774
My superstar, my superstar

1414
01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:04,290
You shine so bright into my heart

1415
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:06,099
My superstar, my superstar

1416
01:23:06,249 --> 01:23:08,297
You shine so bright into my heart

1417
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:11,419
My super crew
Stick together like super glue

1418
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,492
We got the moves like yeah

1419
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,815
We're shining bright

1420
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,693
Throw your hands up to the blue sky

1421
01:23:17,289 --> 01:23:20,020
You, you make me happy

1422
01:23:20,169 --> 01:23:21,170
Sid?

1423
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:22,450
I never thought I'd say this,

1424
01:23:22,529 --> 01:23:24,019
but you did a great job on the wedding.

1425
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:25,500
I owe you bigtime, pal.

1426
01:23:25,649 --> 01:23:26,980
You sure do.

1427
01:23:27,129 --> 01:23:28,779
- Here's my bill.
- What?

1428
01:23:28,929 --> 01:23:30,693
Father of the bride pays for the wedding.

1429
01:23:30,809 --> 01:23:32,300
It's a tradition I just invented.

1430
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:33,895
Wait a minute, this is ridiculous.

1431
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,495
Look what you're charging for flowers!

1432
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:36,776
Flowers ain't cheap.

1433
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,331
No! They're free! We're in a forest!

1434
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:40,651
This bill is outrageous!

1435
01:23:51,370 --> 01:23:52,815
Mars.

1436
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:54,495
The Red Planet.

1437
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:59,014
Cold, dry, inhospitable to life.

1438
01:23:59,170 --> 01:24:02,014
But billions and billions of years ago...

1439
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,172
Mars looked like this.

1440
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:09,178
There were lakes, rivers, oceans...

1441
01:24:09,371 --> 01:24:12,022
the perfect conditions for life to form.

1442
01:24:12,211 --> 01:24:14,657
So, what happened?

1443
01:24:14,811 --> 01:24:17,576
Why was life unable to take hold?

1444
01:24:22,411 --> 01:24:24,061
Where did the water go?

1445
01:24:25,571 --> 01:24:28,222
We may never know.

1446
01:24:47,572 --> 01:24:50,143
Oh I never knew I would make it out

1447
01:24:50,212 --> 01:24:53,375
And come this far, oh I never knew I

1448
01:24:53,452 --> 01:24:55,932
Would see the day we come together

1449
01:24:56,052 --> 01:25:01,616
Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before

1450
01:25:01,732 --> 01:25:03,780
Yeah, baby

1451
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:04,939
You

1452
01:25:05,052 --> 01:25:06,941
You make me happy

1453
01:25:07,052 --> 01:25:09,020
You keep me laughing

1454
01:25:09,092 --> 01:25:12,141
You make my world a better place

1455
01:25:12,252 --> 01:25:13,253
You

1456
01:25:13,372 --> 01:25:14,862
You are my rainbow

1457
01:25:14,932 --> 01:25:17,857
You color my day so bright

1458
01:25:17,933 --> 01:25:20,982
I wanna stay forever with my superstar

1459
01:25:21,093 --> 01:25:22,094
My superstar

1460
01:25:22,213 --> 01:25:24,022
You shine so bright into my heart

1461
01:25:24,093 --> 01:25:26,141
My superstar, my superstar

1462
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:28,654
You shine so bright into my heart

1463
01:25:28,773 --> 01:25:32,823
My love, my love, my love

1464
01:25:32,933 --> 01:25:36,574
You're shining into my heart, heart

1465
01:26:29,655 --> 01:26:31,896
Oh I never knew I would have it all

1466
01:26:32,015 --> 01:26:33,380
Would have it all

1467
01:26:33,495 --> 01:26:35,975
Oh I never knew I would feel so good

1468
01:26:36,055 --> 01:26:37,545
Would feel the full

1469
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:40,181
Oh I never knew I would live the dream

1470
01:26:40,295 --> 01:26:41,535
It's so, so real

1471
01:26:41,695 --> 01:26:44,221
Oh I never knew I would see the day

1472
01:26:44,335 --> 01:26:45,825
We'd come together

1473
01:26:45,895 --> 01:26:50,139
Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before

1474
01:26:50,215 --> 01:26:53,822
Before, before

1475
01:26:53,895 --> 01:26:54,942
You

1476
01:26:55,015 --> 01:26:56,699
You make me happy

1477
01:26:56,815 --> 01:26:58,783
You keep me laughing

1478
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:01,904
You make my world a better place

1479
01:27:02,015 --> 01:27:03,062
You

1480
01:27:03,215 --> 01:27:04,786
You are my rainbow

1481
01:27:04,856 --> 01:27:07,746
You color my day so bright

1482
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:10,746
I wanna stay forever with my superstar

1483
01:27:10,856 --> 01:27:11,903
My superstar

1484
01:27:12,016 --> 01:27:13,939
You shine so bright into my heart

1485
01:27:14,056 --> 01:27:15,979
My superstar, my superstar

1486
01:27:16,056 --> 01:27:18,627
You shine so bright into my heart

1487
01:27:18,736 --> 01:27:22,661
My love, my love, my love

1488
01:27:22,736 --> 01:27:24,659
You're shining into my heart, heart

1489
01:27:26,896 --> 01:27:30,787
You're shining bright,
bright, bright, bright

1490
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:35,026
You're shining so bright

1491
01:27:35,096 --> 01:27:39,101
My love, my love, my love

1492
01:27:39,256 --> 01:27:42,818
You're shining into my heart, yeah, yeah

1493
01:27:42,897 --> 01:27:43,978
You

1494
01:27:44,057 --> 01:27:45,946
You make me happy

1495
01:27:46,097 --> 01:27:48,145
You keep me laughing

1496
01:27:48,257 --> 01:27:51,101
You make my world a better place

1497
01:27:51,217 --> 01:27:52,218
You

1498
01:27:52,297 --> 01:27:53,947
You are my rainbow

1499
01:27:54,057 --> 01:27:57,186
You color my day so bright

1500
01:27:57,257 --> 01:27:59,419
I wanna stay forever with my superstar

1501
01:28:00,097 --> 01:28:01,144
My superstar

1502
01:28:01,257 --> 01:28:03,783
You shine so bright into my heart

1503
01:28:04,097 --> 01:28:07,988
You're shining into my heart

1504
01:28:11,777 --> 01:28:15,498
Ooh, Dream Weaver

1505
01:28:15,617 --> 01:28:22,103
I believe you can get me through the night

1506
01:28:24,738 --> 01:28:28,743
Ooh, Dream Weaver

1507
01:28:28,818 --> 01:28:35,463
I believe we can reach the morning light

1508
01:28:36,418 --> 01:28:42,983
Though the dawn may be coming soon

1509
01:28:43,098 --> 01:28:47,706
There still may be some time

1510
01:28:49,498 --> 01:28:55,302
Fly me away to the bright side of the moon

1511
01:28:56,659 --> 01:29:02,541
And meet me on the other side

1512
01:29:04,819 --> 01:29:08,540
Ooh, Dream Weaver

1513
01:29:08,659 --> 01:29:15,508
I believe you can get me through the night

1514
01:29:17,659 --> 01:29:21,823
Ooh, Dream Weaver

1515
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:28,545
I believe we can reach the morning light

1516
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:37,986
Dream Weaver

1517
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:51,863
Dream Weaver
