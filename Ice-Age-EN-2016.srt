1
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,870
The universe. A vast expanse
of space and matter.

2
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:56,209
It concludes what we see
and what we all know.

3
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:01,599
We have always wondered
how the universe came into being.

4
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:04,360
A grand orchestrated plan?

5
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:07,121
A chance for a series of advancements?

6
00:01:07,384 --> 00:01:10,408
Or something much, much...

7
00:01:10,539 --> 00:01:12,511
judge?

8
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:23,227
Ice Age Collision Course (2016)

9
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:31,773
It's a beautiful day here on the ice,
father against daughter in a game of ice hockey.

10
00:05:31,773 --> 00:05:34,665
It's Peaches vs. Manny.
Mammoth against mammoth.

11
00:05:34,796 --> 00:05:36,768
Mano Wa Mana.
- Pamper me moema.

12
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:39,529
Mama me mimi.
- Do you two want to call it quits?

13
00:05:40,318 --> 00:05:44,262
Moke, Mimi.
- The fiery Mammoth breaks loose.

14
00:05:44,394 --> 00:05:48,995
There never was such a rugged player. So awesome.
- So desperate to score.

15
00:05:49,258 --> 00:05:53,334
He makes a feint to the right, feint to the left.
- He seems like he knows how to play.

16
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:58,198
What is? Lost something?

17
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,616
What stinks and smells and is afraid?
It's Manny.

18
00:06:01,748 --> 00:06:03,983
It's Manny. You are bad.

19
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:08,190
Okay, fluffy ball. Show what you've got.
- You're asking for it.

20
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:21,337
Yes, she dominates. Again.
- Come on, I was calm with you.

21
00:06:21,469 --> 00:06:25,281
It calls a good elder.
- Yes correct. Admit it.

22
00:06:25,413 --> 00:06:30,803
I rule the ice now.
- You talk big, splat. Okay best of three?

23
00:06:31,723 --> 00:06:35,536
Yes. Touchdown. Wait that's not right.
Not Touchdown.

24
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,640
What is it? Hole in one.

25
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:40,926
Julian.
- Sorry.

26
00:06:40,926 --> 00:06:43,687
Honey, I scored. Did you see it?
- Yes.

27
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,631
And you were great.
- Carefully.

28
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:52,364
The ice is really slippery.
Super extra smooth, see?

29
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,468
But I'm doing better now, right?

30
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:02,488
We'll play... later.

31
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:07,221
Well, she beat you again huh?
- I didn't know clumsiness was a monkey thing.

32
00:07:07,352 --> 00:07:11,559
That was a lot of messing around.
- Nobody fumbled, there was no fumbling.

33
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:15,372
Just a sweet dad shared some strategy
with his only daughter.

34
00:07:15,372 --> 00:07:18,396
Didn't know it was a lame strategy.

35
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,471
Okay, it's our turn.
- Let's see how it's done.

36
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:25,890
You're going down.

37
00:07:31,674 --> 00:07:35,093
For you, my mother-in-law that you become.
Buttercups.

38
00:07:35,224 --> 00:07:39,957
Natural sunshine.
- Is it sunshine? Natural sunshine.

39
00:07:40,614 --> 00:07:44,953
Thank you, Julian. It's been so long since
someone gave me flowers.

40
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:48,634
You're marrying our daughter.
You don't always have to bring a gift.

41
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:50,343
It makes me happy.

42
00:07:50,475 --> 00:07:54,813
And to you, my guru, my rock,
my mammoth Manny.

43
00:07:54,945 --> 00:07:58,100
To you, I give you the greatest gift
of all.

44
00:07:58,626 --> 00:08:03,885
Wait, what are you doing?
- Come on, brother. Give me a hug.

45
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:11,510
I can hear your heartbeat.
- Okay, that's enough.

46
00:08:11,904 --> 00:08:14,665
You better get used to it.
He's going to live next door to us.

47
00:08:14,797 --> 00:08:16,506
Come along, Julian. Do you want to go?

48
00:08:16,506 --> 00:08:20,450
Actually, won't you help me?
With the thing.

49
00:08:20,976 --> 00:08:24,263
Right, the thing. I have to do the thing.

50
00:08:24,657 --> 00:08:26,761
I can do the thing.
- No!

51
00:08:27,812 --> 00:08:32,808
It's a girl thing.
- Hey, why don't you do a boy thing?

52
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,095
You make little time for your friends.
- Don't I?

53
00:08:36,227 --> 00:08:40,434
I'll see you later. On this special day.

54
00:08:42,406 --> 00:08:45,693
Have you told us about our decision yet?
- No.

55
00:08:45,824 --> 00:08:49,242
I'm waiting for the right moment.
- Come along, Romeo. Walk with me.

56
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:53,055
I'm going to watch some butterflies
emerge from their cocoons. - Real?

57
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,553
No.
- Goodbye, dear.

58
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:01,206
I remember when Manny and I were like this.
- Not me.

59
00:09:01,338 --> 00:09:05,808
Love him, leave him and take half.
That's my motto.

60
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,752
My love.

61
00:09:10,015 --> 00:09:15,537
So many women have tried and failed
at Sid the Stallion.

62
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,138
But I want to share everything with you.

63
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:24,477
You are the wind among my fleas.
The algae in my eye.

64
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:28,026
Do you want to be my partner forever?

65
00:09:33,942 --> 00:09:35,520
Sid, where are you?

66
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,536
I have to ask you something. Do you want to marry...
- I want to interrupt you here.

67
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:50,639
I'm breaking up with you.
- What?

68
00:09:50,771 --> 00:09:53,926
But I planned our entire future.
Our marriage.

69
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:55,898
Our children.

70
00:09:56,293 --> 00:09:58,528
Our cemetery.
- How are you?

71
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,631
I even rented a band.

72
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:03,129
No no. Not yet.

73
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:06,416
Are you crazy? We only have one day.

74
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,519
At least fourteen minutes.
- Yes.

75
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:12,858
But it felt like twenty.
I can't do it, a ring?

76
00:10:12,858 --> 00:10:15,750
I mean I like the ring.
But you can't, you're too clingy.

77
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,459
How is this sticky?

78
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,192
And another thing, you don't look
like your profile picture either.

79
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,953
Francine, you should date outside your kind.

80
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:28,766
Wait, we can fix this.
Is it about this beginning?

81
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:34,025
I didn't know it was poison ivy.

82
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:43,228
Help! Someone.

83
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:47,435
Is it the eyes that hurt?
Or my soul?

84
00:10:48,487 --> 00:10:50,327
Definitely the eyes.

85
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:59,530
Women.
- Yes, women.

86
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:02,554
What's with that?
- I don't understand them.

87
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:04,921
Like, Ellie.

88
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:10,574
Life is good with her. No surprises,
no changes. But today.

89
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:13,992
She giggled.
Has Shira ever giggled?

90
00:11:14,781 --> 00:11:16,753
Please don't eat me.

91
00:11:18,068 --> 00:11:21,486
Shira isn't much of a giggler.
- Well, Ellie giggled.

92
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,852
And then she rocks.

93
00:11:25,036 --> 00:11:28,980
Never do this again.
- I have no idea why she's acting so strange.

94
00:11:29,637 --> 00:11:31,346
Women?
- Women?

95
00:11:31,872 --> 00:11:32,924
Women.

96
00:11:34,765 --> 00:11:36,737
Talk about weird.

97
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,314
Anybody here?

98
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,991
Hi, Manny.
Your breath is horrible.

99
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,015
What happened to you?
- Nothing, everything is fine.

100
00:11:50,147 --> 00:11:52,645
Fantastic. Zippedi dippedi.

101
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,143
Let me guess. She dumped you?

102
00:11:55,274 --> 00:11:57,378
What is wrong with me?

103
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,138
Everyone has someone.

104
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:05,134
And all I have is my
looks and Mexican ties.

105
00:12:10,393 --> 00:12:14,337
So, itchy.
- Come on, let's get you fixed up.

106
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:49,868
I only want real love.
Is that too much to ask?

107
00:14:52,497 --> 00:14:57,493
Why is it so quiet?
- Because the world mourns with you.

108
00:15:00,911 --> 00:15:04,067
Where is everyone?
- Surprise!

109
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,266
Congratulations on our anniversary, honey.
- wedding day?

110
00:15:18,528 --> 00:15:21,289
Oh no. That's the thing.

111
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,257
Now it's your turn brother.
- Yes, we want to see what you have for Ellie.

112
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:35,883
correct.

113
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,747
Well... another cheer for Ellie?

114
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:45,217
He forgot it.

115
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,504
I feel so bad for Ellie.

116
00:15:49,687 --> 00:15:52,448
I uh...I...

117
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:09,539
He hadn't forgotten.
What great love for her, from Manny.

118
00:16:11,511 --> 00:16:13,615
Nice save with the fireworks.

119
00:16:14,009 --> 00:16:17,428
Wait, you didn't do this?
Then, who did it?

120
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:23,475
I was a bit afraid you had forgotten.
But you lit up the sky, for me?

121
00:16:23,475 --> 00:16:26,105
How did you do that?
- Well, well...

122
00:16:26,236 --> 00:16:29,260
A magician never reveals his secrets.

123
00:16:30,969 --> 00:16:32,284
Thank you.

124
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:42,933
I imagine, our own children there.

125
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:46,220
He would be the best.
- I think you mean "they".

126
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,403
He.

127
00:16:47,403 --> 00:16:51,216
Anyway, we talked about it.
Children are afraid of us.

128
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:53,188
But why?

129
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:58,184
Are they going to eat us?

130
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:00,287
Hi guys!

131
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:05,678
I even laughed this time.

132
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:15,801
Well, Dad. Best gift ever.

133
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:19,613
You, sir. Are an education
in moral excellence.

134
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:23,032
I'm really going to miss you when we
leave the house.

135
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:28,948
I actually hadn't told them that yet.

136
00:17:29,737 --> 00:17:32,103
Surprise...
- You're leaving.

137
00:17:32,235 --> 00:17:35,521
I thought you
were staying with us for a few more years.

138
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:39,334
Julian and I are going to Rome for a while.
- Rome?

139
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,884
Travel, explore, discover whatever.

140
00:17:43,015 --> 00:17:46,565
No plan is the best plan.
That's my philosophy.

141
00:17:46,828 --> 00:17:49,852
What fruit?
- That's not a plan or a philosophy

142
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:53,139
or very safe.
- Dad, we're young.

143
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:57,083
We can worry about safety
when we're old and boring, like you and Mom.

144
00:17:57,214 --> 00:18:01,027
I think we...
- Excuse me, this is a family discussion.

145
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:04,840
But am I not part of your family?
- You're not yet.

146
00:18:10,493 --> 00:18:12,991
Does this seem like a problem for you?

147
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:19,433
Fire coming directly towards us.
Why would this be a problem.

148
00:18:19,564 --> 00:18:22,720
What if you get amnesia?
Then what, huh?

149
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:25,349
We have a problem.
- Not now, I have a problem.

150
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,584
This one is a bit bigger.
- I do not think so.

151
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,425
What?

152
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:39,679
Party's over, everyone.
Have a good night and leave now.

153
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:42,572
What are you talking about?
The party was just getting started.

154
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:46,910
I'm getting a little sleepy.
Everyone better leave.

155
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,117
And dive into possible cover.
- Hey, what have you got all of a sudden?

156
00:18:58,874 --> 00:19:00,320
There's more to come.

157
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:04,790
A meteor shower.

158
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:08,472
Meteors?
- Rain?

159
00:19:10,312 --> 00:19:12,942
Manny's love will be the death of us.

160
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:15,965
If this
is your supposed magical party for me.

161
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,252
Abracadabra?
- Can you talk about it later?

162
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:21,224
Come on, we have to take shelter.

163
00:19:25,563 --> 00:19:27,535
I'm on fire.

164
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:31,085
Me, too. We're smoking hot, baby.

165
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,212
Incoming.
- I've got them.

166
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,156
Are you OK ? How many tusks do you see?
- Tree.

167
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,208
What boom?

168
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,443
No, tree......

169
00:19:51,331 --> 00:19:54,092
Everyone, jump!

170
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:07,634
Into the cave, go inside.
Fast.

171
00:20:19,992 --> 00:20:22,884
It's okay honey. Dad is...

172
00:20:32,745 --> 00:20:34,848
It seems like it is decreasing.

173
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:38,398
Yes, it's definitely over.

174
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:46,155
Except on the after.

175
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:51,019
I think we
'll have to stay underground for a while.

176
00:21:11,134 --> 00:21:12,318
Give back.....

177
00:21:12,318 --> 00:21:15,078
I have an egg.
How many eggs do you have little brother.

178
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,365
Should we steal all those eggs?
Can't we go vegetarian?

179
00:21:18,497 --> 00:21:22,046
Sure, we can eat vegan.

180
00:21:22,441 --> 00:21:26,648
Son, sometimes I wonder how you
came to be in this family.

181
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:35,062
I'll be right back.
I need to rid myself of something.

182
00:21:35,062 --> 00:21:38,743
That weasel is such a spoiler.
Let's go guys.

183
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:43,213
Don't worry lady.
I'm taking down this bunch who stole your egg.

184
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:48,078
It's a bowl.
A Wink under my eye patch.

185
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:07,930
Well played guys.

186
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,769
Please, ma'am.

187
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:23,920
Go, I'll distract them.

188
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:31,546
That was fun.
Same time, same place, next week?

189
00:23:31,677 --> 00:23:33,123
Toudeludo

190
00:23:34,175 --> 00:23:39,171
Congratulations weasel.
You just signed your death warrant.

191
00:23:41,274 --> 00:23:43,641
I did that beautifully again.

192
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:47,059
What's all that flashy stuff there?

193
00:23:47,979 --> 00:23:50,872
What's a rock doing here
in the middle of the jungle?

194
00:24:23,345 --> 00:24:24,660
Jeminee.

195
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:27,552
What kind of place is this?

196
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:06,024
Hello, mammals.
- Hey, Buck.

197
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,442
Goodbye, Buck.

198
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:11,546
A little help?

199
00:26:17,594 --> 00:26:22,064
Right to the spleen. Totally useless,
but it hurts.

200
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:25,088
Welcome back, buddy.
- Guard...

201
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,585
This snack snack is a dinosaur whisperer?

202
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,083
An expert als salsa dancer.

203
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,709
I have one eye, but all my original teeth.
Do you want to count them?

204
00:26:38,366 --> 00:26:39,549
No thanks.

205
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:44,282
And this here must be nectarine?

206
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:48,095
So romantic my love. I am very honored.

207
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:51,776
Nice eye patch, very gangster.

208
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:55,063
Thank you, I like this guy.

209
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,876
What are you doing here?
- Well, me, what?

210
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,346
I try. But how do you tell someone
they are doomed?

211
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:05,449
He's stupid.

212
00:27:05,975 --> 00:27:10,051
We are not doomed. It was just a
meteor show and the show is over.

213
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:11,760
On the contrary, old chap.

214
00:27:12,417 --> 00:27:14,258
This is just the beginning.

215
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:18,202
You see... I found a prediction.

216
00:27:23,592 --> 00:27:24,907
Can he again?

217
00:27:25,433 --> 00:27:28,588
Boy, he's always a spoilsport.

218
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,903
Killjoy!

219
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:35,030
I read this stone from cover to cover.
And what it says is very disturbing.

220
00:27:35,162 --> 00:27:39,763
Every hundred million years the world enters
a cosmic scene.

221
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:44,759
Before the dinosaurs, there was
a jackdaw crab-like thing.

222
00:27:45,811 --> 00:27:49,623
An asteroid impact at the top of this mountain range .

223
00:27:50,412 --> 00:27:51,990
Bye. Next one.

224
00:27:52,121 --> 00:27:56,066
Dinosaurs, top of this mountain range, asteroid.
Boom! Bye.

225
00:27:56,197 --> 00:28:01,061
And next up, mammals.
Top of this mountain range, asteroid. Boom!

226
00:28:03,165 --> 00:28:04,348
Farewell.

227
00:28:04,874 --> 00:28:07,898
Stupid mammals.
- That's us.

228
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:16,707
And there she is.
The mother of all asteroids is heading towards us.

229
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:20,256
Even going underground
won't save us this time.

230
00:28:20,388 --> 00:28:21,965
That wasn't there before.

231
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:26,567
And look what it does to the air.
- Don't worry, because I have a plan.

232
00:28:26,698 --> 00:28:29,328
Real? To stop an asteroid?

233
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,929
Look. The last two asteroids
hit the same spot.

234
00:28:33,929 --> 00:28:37,348
And it will happen again.
We're going to that place.

235
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:39,845
And find out what attracts the asteroid.

236
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:43,921
Once we know why it's getting there. Let's figure
out how to send it somewhere else.

237
00:28:44,053 --> 00:28:47,865
That plan is so stupid. I wish it
had a face so I could punch it.

238
00:28:47,997 --> 00:28:51,941
Let me get this straight. Instead of
running away from an asteroid,

239
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:54,307
You want us to go there?

240
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:57,463
I know, it doesn't sound optimal.
But the good news is,

241
00:28:57,594 --> 00:28:59,698
it kills us wherever we are.

242
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:04,168
Well that's pretty worry-free.
- Even if we go to the impact site.

243
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:08,243
How are we supposed to change
what is literally written on that stone?

244
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,478
Ah, my cynical friend.

245
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:14,159
The dinosaurs were wiped from the Earth,
but some escaped.

246
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:17,446
She changed their faith,
and we can change ours too.

247
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:19,287
Who's coming along?

248
00:29:22,837 --> 00:29:24,546
Well? What do you think?

249
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:27,570
Frankly, I worry
that the weasel is right.

250
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:32,040
No, don't listen to the weasel.
He's a fool.

251
00:29:33,749 --> 00:29:38,350
I like to reenact "The Devil's Advocate."
I look great.

252
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:44,398
Well, Buck has saved our lives before.
- But what if he can't do it this time.

253
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,896
I don't know what to believe.
But...

254
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:50,446
I'm afraid our lives will end
before they even begin.

255
00:29:55,836 --> 00:29:58,202
I believe... we're in.

256
00:29:58,202 --> 00:30:00,963
Crash and Eddie are happy to reinforce the troops.

257
00:30:01,226 --> 00:30:02,541
Rubbish ....

258
00:30:03,198 --> 00:30:06,091
Excellent and dirty word processed.

259
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:08,983
Well, we better go right away.
Because the time of impact

260
00:30:08,983 --> 00:30:12,796
approximately happens in two days,
four hours, one minute and sixteen seconds.

261
00:30:12,927 --> 00:30:16,608
Fifteen seconds, fourteen seconds, thirteen...
- I think we get it.

262
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,369
I think we'll all get it.

263
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,018
We look so cool.

264
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,381
What is this?

265
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,651
Where is he? I've had enough, with that
one eyed weasel,

266
00:31:00,783 --> 00:31:03,281
he'll need two eye patches.

267
00:31:04,464 --> 00:31:08,014
I admire your bloodthirsty attitude, Goat.
But you heard him.

268
00:31:08,145 --> 00:31:10,249
An asteroid is on its way.

269
00:31:11,037 --> 00:31:12,746
This changes things.

270
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:18,005
Holy snowballs it's freezing here.

271
00:31:18,137 --> 00:31:20,109
Attract parts to other parts.

272
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,396
Will you please stop
acting like a parakeet.

273
00:31:23,396 --> 00:31:27,734
It's a good thing that you have your mother's eyes . Or you were completely useless.

274
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:30,101
Well, that was insensitive.

275
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,439
What do you see?

276
00:31:35,097 --> 00:31:36,148
Nothing.

277
00:31:36,937 --> 00:31:37,857
Nothing.

278
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:41,013
Deadly asteroids
hurtling towards Earth.

279
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:43,379
Wait, there he is.

280
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:46,535
That's too bad. He's really far away.

281
00:31:46,666 --> 00:31:50,216
Probably too far to fly to.
Well, let's go home.

282
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:52,056
We're not going to back down.

283
00:31:52,188 --> 00:31:57,710
Until that weasel came along, our family made an
honest living stealing dinosaur eggs.

284
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:01,654
An honest life, stealing.
A bit ironic don't you think?

285
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:05,861
Besides, why take the weasel
if the asteroid is going to hit us?

286
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,622
So much sight, so little vision.

287
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:13,355
If we stop the weasel and his friends
from distributing the asteroids.

288
00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:17,825
It kills the weasel and everyone else
while we...

289
00:32:17,956 --> 00:32:20,586
fly safely above everything.

290
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:23,872
It will be our paradise.

291
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:30,183
That seems very unlikely, from a
scientific standpoint.

292
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,944
Good. It's a great plan, dynamite...

293
00:32:33,075 --> 00:32:36,099
one of the top three or four,
extermination of a race I ever heard.

294
00:32:36,231 --> 00:32:41,621
That's better. Now let's make
sure the asteroid hits its target.

295
00:32:41,884 --> 00:32:45,828
Why can't we be afraid
of destruction like a normal family?

296
00:34:25,615 --> 00:34:28,770
What are you doing?
- Old stones tell a story.

297
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,240
Where we've been and where we've hidden.

298
00:34:36,395 --> 00:34:39,156
That's a turd.

299
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,308
I want you to know if we don't make it.

300
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:49,543
If we'll never be married.

301
00:34:49,674 --> 00:34:53,750
You were the only one for me.
- Hey, come on.

302
00:34:53,881 --> 00:34:56,510
Of course we'll make it.
And we're getting married.

303
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:59,929
But maybe the universe is telling us
we won't.

304
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:02,953
You're going to have one tiny...

305
00:35:03,084 --> 00:35:06,502
let an asteroid 300 miles wide
ruin your plans?

306
00:35:06,502 --> 00:35:09,263
How can we think about our future
if we don't get one?

307
00:35:09,263 --> 00:35:13,865
We're going to stop that thing.
And you will be married. Bada bing bada boom.

308
00:35:13,996 --> 00:35:16,626
Well don't boom, forget I said boom.

309
00:35:17,677 --> 00:35:20,307
I know something.
I will be your Wedding Planner.

310
00:35:20,438 --> 00:35:23,594
It takes you away from all this
end of the world stuff.

311
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:27,406
Well, actually we weren't going to prepare it.

312
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:28,852
What?

313
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:33,059
Honey, you're not going to throw away the happiest day of your life, are you ?

314
00:35:33,454 --> 00:35:36,478
No, you take it
and you cherish it.

315
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:39,107
You strangle it with good attention.

316
00:35:40,422 --> 00:35:42,788
Let's start with your hair.

317
00:35:43,051 --> 00:35:45,944
We do it traditionally.

318
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:50,545
Or, go all the way with a fish headdress.
Flair tasted.

319
00:35:51,203 --> 00:35:53,963
But maybe a little dirty.

320
00:35:55,147 --> 00:36:00,405
And leg straps.
Today refreshing models daisies.

321
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:05,138
But Crash is wearing
an elegant hat on his head today.

322
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,214
We need seats.
The bachelor's table, the children's table,

323
00:36:09,346 --> 00:36:12,632
the strange family table.
The smelling table.

324
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,839
Look at him.
- You're going to love it.

325
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:18,549
Who walks like that?

326
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:22,098
Look at me. I'm Julian.

327
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:26,305
Forget the asteroid and give me
a hug, brother.

328
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:28,935
Look at that beautiful bird there.

329
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:33,536
That's a beautiful bird. Good eyes Manny.

330
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:39,452
This guy doesn't understand anything,
we're just going for a walk in the wilderness...

331
00:36:39,584 --> 00:36:43,002
no plans but walking with mr.
- Stop picking on him.

332
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:47,604
Come on, you're not mad at me anymore, are you?
- No, I'm not angry anymore.

333
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:50,890
Because I don't want to waste our last time
together like this.

334
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,440
But if we somehow
survive that space rock..

335
00:36:54,572 --> 00:36:57,727
are you screwed?
- If we survive, we'll lose our daughter.

336
00:36:57,727 --> 00:37:03,906
Well, I thought about that too. But if...
- I know what, we'll destroy their relationship. Correct?

337
00:37:04,038 --> 00:37:08,639
Then we don't have to let her go
and she will remain our little girl forever.

338
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:16,001
No you psychopath. What if we
can convince her to stay by our side.

339
00:37:16,922 --> 00:37:22,575
That's better. I like this, but how?
- The way we always did it.

340
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:27,439
We let her think it was her idea.
- Necessary, Necessary plan.

341
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,041
Let's hope we haven't lost our feeling.
- Found it!

342
00:37:33,356 --> 00:37:37,826
Behold mammals. A sneaky preview
of what the asteroid will look like.

343
00:37:37,957 --> 00:37:41,901
A space rock, fresh from the cosmos.

344
00:37:50,315 --> 00:37:54,260
Space tastes lonely.
- Hey look, I found another one.

345
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,443
Me, too.

346
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:06,486
Hey, you attract me so much.
- No, you attract me like that.

347
00:38:09,642 --> 00:38:12,140
I'm just too attractive.

348
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:16,084
Stupid Now we have something
to play with in our final hours.

349
00:38:16,215 --> 00:38:19,633
You're missing the point, tiger.
They're magnets.

350
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:24,498
And if these space stones are magnetic.
Then this one too.

351
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:28,705
This can only mean one thing.

352
00:38:28,968 --> 00:38:31,071
And that is ?

353
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:33,307
Allow me.

354
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:40,012
Where are we?
- You're in my head.

355
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:44,744
A bit chilly.
- Gentlemen, that's what we know.

356
00:38:45,007 --> 00:38:48,557
Space stones, magnetic.
Asteroids, also magnetic.

357
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,896
Fanastro, but this is Neal
the Buck weasel.

358
00:38:53,027 --> 00:38:54,999
He knows the cosmos.

359
00:38:56,708 --> 00:39:00,521
The impact side should have a hypro thing that
attracts the asteroid.

360
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:03,150
Perfect Buck. He has the right angle

361
00:39:03,545 --> 00:39:08,409
what if we use the magnetic
to attract the asteroid somewhere else.

362
00:39:08,541 --> 00:39:12,485
Theoretically speaking: If we
can launch a few of these into space,

363
00:39:12,616 --> 00:39:15,377
they pull the Asteroid off course.

364
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,401
So we save the world.

365
00:39:20,768 --> 00:39:23,134
We just have to
get to the impact site

366
00:39:23,266 --> 00:39:25,238
and throw a lot of stones into space.

367
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:29,050
That's easy, right?
- Yes, it sounds very simple.

368
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:33,783
This is progress, now we know exactly what
not to do.

369
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,887
Follow me, mammals.

370
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:39,305
This road takes us directly to the impact.

371
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,090
Okay, guys. Let's have some fun.

372
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:52,584
Everyone follow the trail.
Never leave the trail.

373
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,153
Everyone leaves the track, towards the forest.
Go, go.

374
00:40:04,153 --> 00:40:09,280
But you just said...
- You know I'm crazy. Come on.

375
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,137
I like the shade.
Not you?

376
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:29,921
Well played weasel. Stay sharp guys.
They can't keep hiding.

377
00:40:42,411 --> 00:40:45,041
Do you have any suggestions on how we can go around the river?

378
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:49,511
Let's see where the tablet of wisdom
will take us.

379
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:18,303
Let my mammals pass through.
- This will never work.

380
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:30,135
The age-old safe passage.
- Nice.

381
00:41:55,509 --> 00:41:58,139
The air feels strange.

382
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:07,210
What?

383
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:24,564
Finally, we have super powers.

384
00:42:27,983 --> 00:42:32,584
Ladies and gentlemen, we admire
an electrical storm.

385
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:37,711
I suggest staying away from the trees.
- Certainly no problem.

386
00:42:37,843 --> 00:42:40,604
Fortunately we are not in the forest.

387
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:47,966
Boy, mother nature is apparently in a
bad mood.

388
00:42:47,966 --> 00:42:52,042
The good thing is, we are here to help each other.
- As I always say...

389
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,671
stay close, stay alive.

390
00:43:00,587 --> 00:43:03,480
There they are. Right in plain sight.

391
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:08,607
How stupid can you be?
- Come on guys, dive!

392
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:18,468
Everyone, try not to create any kind of friction.

393
00:43:18,468 --> 00:43:20,965
No friction, got it.

394
00:43:22,412 --> 00:43:24,384
What is friction again?

395
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:38,846
Come on, let's get out of here.

396
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:48,312
Quick, Grandma.
- Do not rush me.

397
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:51,072
I've been struck by lightning before
...

398
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:52,256
My...

399
00:43:52,782 --> 00:43:54,885
than you had breakfast.

400
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:05,271
Do not move!

401
00:44:08,032 --> 00:44:09,610
I have an idea.

402
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:12,108
I'm coming sweetie.

403
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:16,183
Julian, why don't you help her?
- Wait, no Manny, she's...

404
00:44:21,048 --> 00:44:23,283
What are you doing?
- To help?

405
00:44:23,414 --> 00:44:25,649
Which doesn't seem to help.

406
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,331
Hey, lightning heads.

407
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:38,271
Be ready to run.

408
00:44:39,454 --> 00:44:41,426
Run! Let's go!

409
00:44:52,864 --> 00:44:54,704
Everyone made it?

410
00:44:56,545 --> 00:44:58,780
Ah, I don't have enough fingers.

411
00:44:59,306 --> 00:45:00,752
Where's Buck?

412
00:45:02,856 --> 00:45:04,170
Do you hear that?

413
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:08,772
A baby. There's a baby in there.

414
00:45:09,035 --> 00:45:11,533
Buck is waiting. It is too dangerous.

415
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:20,210
He is gone.
- I can not believe it.

416
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:23,891
We don't know how to
go on without you, Buck.

417
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,732
Okay, let's go.

418
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,676
It's Buck!

419
00:45:36,249 --> 00:45:39,010
I got you, don't worry, I got you.

420
00:45:39,405 --> 00:45:40,588
There you are.

421
00:45:41,508 --> 00:45:43,349
Say hello, everyone.

422
00:45:44,269 --> 00:45:48,739
Isn't she beautiful
- How can he know it's a seed?

423
00:45:50,054 --> 00:45:52,815
What a kuchi woochi you are.

424
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,548
Just to be clear,
that's a pumpkin, right?

425
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:01,097
Well, she's just a bit rough,
but otherwise she's fine.

426
00:46:01,097 --> 00:46:02,938
Yes, you will.

427
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:08,328
I think I'm going to call you Brunwin.
- Little friend.

428
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,272
We have to come back to earth.
While it's still there, okay?

429
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:17,137
Right, you old mammal.
Who saved the world from the dangerous asteroid?

430
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,715
You did it.

431
00:46:37,778 --> 00:46:40,802
Okay, mammals, we'll stop for a while.
- Fuses?

432
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:45,666
What about the end of the world collision?
- The asteroid is still a day away.

433
00:46:45,798 --> 00:46:51,319
As my grandfather always said. "Red sky
at night, that's when sailors get their strength."

434
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:56,578
Cursed air in the night. Who took my
foot cream? I need my foot cream.

435
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,471
Grandpa was an absent-minded angry weasel.

436
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,232
So funny, J.

437
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:07,622
Stop, you're funny.
Rest easy my brother from a tiger mother.

438
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:11,960
See you tomorrow J man.

439
00:47:12,486 --> 00:47:14,984
What was that?
- What was what?

440
00:47:16,825 --> 00:47:20,112
That, it's a cool way to greet.
Julian showed it to me.

441
00:47:20,243 --> 00:47:25,239
Well, I'm glad it brings you closer.
- He's a good kid, like his philosophy.

442
00:47:25,502 --> 00:47:28,263
Give him a chance, be fine with him.

443
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:38,255
Finding it is a good idea.

444
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:44,039
Right, I get you.
-You take Julian, I have an idea for Peaches.

445
00:47:47,984 --> 00:47:51,796
Bro boy.
- Hey brother. You heard the rock thump?

446
00:47:54,031 --> 00:47:57,712
It's not that. How about
a bedtime game?

447
00:47:57,712 --> 00:48:00,605
Not true? You want to play a game with me?

448
00:48:01,262 --> 00:48:05,864
What is honored times a hundred thousand? No!
Times one million.

449
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:09,150
Because all that is equal to.
Is how I feel honored.

450
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:11,648
So... is that a yes?

451
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:17,302
Yes, that's a yes, it's the most yes,
it's like a yes with a whole string of a, like...

452
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:21,114
Awesome.

453
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:23,349
I'll see you on the ice.

454
00:48:27,293 --> 00:48:28,477
Pleased?

455
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:37,943
Sing.

456
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:48,329
Well, do you think you're ready
to wander on your own?

457
00:48:48,329 --> 00:48:51,747
I won't be alone, I have Julian.
- Certainly.

458
00:48:51,747 --> 00:48:53,588
With asteroid rain.

459
00:48:53,588 --> 00:48:56,743
No home speaks without
an absolute support system.

460
00:48:56,874 --> 00:48:58,846
Do you think you're ready for...

461
00:48:58,978 --> 00:49:00,030
it!

462
00:49:01,213 --> 00:49:03,185
I'm a crying baby.

463
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,312
Imagine. You are in the woods looking
for food and your baby gets sick,

464
00:49:08,444 --> 00:49:09,890
what should you do?

465
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:12,914
No, doubting makes it worse.

466
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:21,985
Oh no. Now your eldest
child has a skin problem.

467
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:27,244
Mamie, hold me.
- Your children are crying, you have no food and then.

468
00:49:27,376 --> 00:49:30,400
You come face to face with the rabbit monster.

469
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:36,579
I'm the rabbit monster, who gives
rabies to babies?

470
00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,917
A pyromaniac has broken loose.

471
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:49,331
How are you going to handle all this
without our help?

472
00:50:08,658 --> 00:50:10,367
Peaches, out.

473
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:18,781
Well, that was just the easy part.
There is more that you will experience.

474
00:50:21,016 --> 00:50:22,988
Babie did a poop.

475
00:50:23,382 --> 00:50:27,458
I'm a master actor,
so I want to be refreshed.

476
00:50:29,299 --> 00:50:32,454
So close. I'm going too fast.

477
00:50:32,585 --> 00:50:36,398
Just watch the puck all the way to the stick.

478
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:40,737
I did it!

479
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:45,601
Very sad that you and Peaches are leaving here.
If you stay we can always do this.

480
00:50:46,653 --> 00:50:50,597
So much steam.
I'm like a hockey ninja.

481
00:50:54,804 --> 00:50:58,354
It turns out you
have a new hockey partner who replaces your father.

482
00:51:04,664 --> 00:51:05,979
Oh no.

483
00:51:14,656 --> 00:51:18,600
Such a mystery why he wants to go far away.
I didn't mean to do this.

484
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:22,282
Not my fault he has no reflexes.
- How can you do that to him?

485
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:24,780
I thought you liked him.
I like him.

486
00:51:24,911 --> 00:51:26,226
Well you're not behaving like it.

487
00:51:26,226 --> 00:51:30,564
When you look at him you see him as an
obstacle or worse a goal.

488
00:51:30,564 --> 00:51:35,166
But I see, a sweet boy trying
to impress his heart on you.

489
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:37,927
No, both of you stop it.

490
00:51:38,058 --> 00:51:41,213
If we survive this, I'll still get married
and leave home.

491
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:43,843
Whether you are happy with it or not.

492
00:51:46,735 --> 00:51:50,548
Don't give me that look. She both said
that means for you too.

493
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:57,253
This little friend is on his way home.

494
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:06,324
Because daddy and his friends
are going to save the world.

495
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,121
Sleep tight, little one.

496
00:52:32,356 --> 00:52:36,168
Happiness pumps. Must be nice to
have a lovely father.

497
00:52:37,352 --> 00:52:40,375
Okay, here we go. You can do this, Roger.

498
00:52:41,953 --> 00:52:43,662
Kidnapping.

499
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:50,367
It's not me, I would never do this.
It's my dad, he's crazy.

500
00:52:50,762 --> 00:52:54,837
I can't believe it, he did it.
Well done stupid stupid.

501
00:52:55,363 --> 00:52:59,176
Thanks dad.
- It doesn't matter, I can do this too.

502
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:07,327
Well well. Looks like you're
not going to stop the asteroid now, huh weasel?

503
00:53:08,773 --> 00:53:13,112
That's not the weasel. That's...yuck
whatever it is?

504
00:53:16,662 --> 00:53:19,028
Is it my time, Angel?

505
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:20,737
Time for what?

506
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,841
I come to the light.

507
00:53:22,972 --> 00:53:26,653
Can't wait to
meet the family I hate so much.

508
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:28,362
Get off me!

509
00:53:28,494 --> 00:53:31,123
Go help your sister.
- But Dad.

510
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:33,490
Demon angel.

511
00:53:35,856 --> 00:53:38,749
If you mess with grandma, you won't make it this day.

512
00:53:42,298 --> 00:53:44,533
And that's how it should be done.

513
00:53:47,163 --> 00:53:52,290
Angel, am I in heaven?
It's so dark and narrow here.

514
00:53:52,948 --> 00:53:56,366
No, I still see the light.

515
00:54:03,071 --> 00:54:04,517
I'll save you.

516
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:20,819
Well, this is probably for the best.
- Certainly.

517
00:54:32,783 --> 00:54:33,967
Jeminee.

518
00:54:37,253 --> 00:54:40,014
All right, crazy Buck, what did you do?

519
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:43,958
Okay, mammals. Time to leave.
Well, the link here from...

520
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:48,691
Yes, I read the tablet wrong.
The asteroid is a bit denser.

521
00:54:52,767 --> 00:54:55,133
Wait a minute, where's grandma?

522
00:54:57,763 --> 00:55:01,444
Maybe she got lost?
- Maybe they hit her head with a puck?

523
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:06,440
Yes, maybe kidnapped by giant
Dino birds who want to avenge me.

524
00:55:06,571 --> 00:55:09,464
All good theories.
I'm going for the puck.

525
00:55:11,304 --> 00:55:12,356
I knew it.

526
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:15,511
So all this time we're being chased
by giant dinosaur birds?

527
00:55:15,643 --> 00:55:18,272
There are only three.
I didn't want to tell you.

528
00:55:18,404 --> 00:55:22,085
Because we
were previously on a worry-free cruise?

529
00:55:22,217 --> 00:55:23,268
Wait a second.

530
00:55:23,926 --> 00:55:25,898
I have a lead.
Come on.

531
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:40,622
Mammals, we made it.

532
00:55:41,017 --> 00:55:45,487
The impact side,
this must be from the previous asteroid.

533
00:55:47,459 --> 00:55:49,168
Your space stones.

534
00:55:51,272 --> 00:55:54,558
We can definitely beat the asteroid
with magnetic rocks.

535
00:55:54,558 --> 00:56:00,080
I mean that thing is huge, it's massive, it's...
- Impossible to get off the ground.

536
00:56:00,212 --> 00:56:04,419
It's absolutely possible in ways
we don't know yet.

537
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,100
But what about the dinosaur birds?
- And what about grandma?

538
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:10,861
Nothing.

539
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:13,096
I'm sorry Sid.

540
00:56:15,857 --> 00:56:18,749
My dear evil grandma.

541
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:22,562
Why do the old people always have to
die first?

542
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:31,239
I can still
hear her sweet whimsical voice. Squeaking from the afterlife.

543
00:56:33,211 --> 00:56:36,103
Grandma, still alive.
- And she's in trouble.

544
00:56:58,191 --> 00:57:01,477
Is she okay?
- Um, I'm not sure.

545
00:57:06,342 --> 00:57:10,023
Stay away from my grandma.
- If you do that, you don't get a tip.

546
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:13,704
To make this beautiful cutie happy?
Its all the payment I need.

547
00:57:13,704 --> 00:57:16,202
You see, stuffed bunny has it.

548
00:57:17,911 --> 00:57:20,672
There's a rabbit living in this asteroid?

549
00:57:20,935 --> 00:57:24,879
I didn't see that coming.
- Wait until you see this.

550
00:57:36,975 --> 00:57:40,919
Huge height on the halfpipe.
- This is crazy.

551
00:57:41,050 --> 00:57:44,205
Do you think they know they live in a
magnetic Bullseye?

552
00:57:44,337 --> 00:57:47,624
It doesn't look like a doomsday
is going to happen here.

553
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:52,357
I can't believe it, visitors.
We never had any visitors.

554
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:55,643
Give me a squeeze?
Or shall I pinch you?

555
00:57:55,775 --> 00:57:59,456
Wait I squeeze both of us.
- Did I hit my head?

556
00:57:59,456 --> 00:58:01,165
What's happening here?

557
00:58:01,691 --> 00:58:03,663
I'll show you, this is a...

558
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:06,818
dream.

559
00:58:18,782 --> 00:58:22,595
This guy? Real?
- Whatever.

560
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:29,432
Well, hello handsome.
I'm Brooke.

561
00:58:31,404 --> 00:58:35,611
What a strong cheek structure,
what a strong chin.

562
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:39,818
I feel butterflies.
- I feel sick.

563
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:43,367
Sorry to disturb your love contact
but we are in a hurry.

564
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:48,363
If we don't act quickly, that asteroid
is going to blow us over with us right in the middle of it.

565
00:58:50,204 --> 00:58:55,594
That sounds urgent. I'll take you to him.
- Who's him? Your leader?

566
00:58:55,726 --> 00:58:59,801
He is our everything.
- He sees everything.

567
00:59:00,196 --> 00:59:04,008
He knows everything.
- And smells incredible.

568
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:09,530
Well, it sounds great. Let's go.
- Beautiful, this way.

569
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:24,912
Keep your arms and legs inside the plate
the entire time.

570
00:59:25,307 --> 00:59:28,594
But let your mind
guide you to freedom.

571
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:33,195
In geotopia.
- I have a good feeling about this.

572
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:38,717
Maybe he can help us.
- She said he knows everything, and everything is a lot.

573
00:59:42,792 --> 00:59:46,211
Here he is, the master of meditation.

574
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:51,995
The highest sovereign. The four-time
heavyweight champion of the world.

575
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:08,824
Is that a llama? I hate llamas
they spit and stink.

576
01:00:08,824 --> 01:00:11,190
Like herself.
- Like us.

577
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:26,178
Greetings mammals.
The Shangri Lama will see you...

578
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:31,437
now.
- Awesome.

579
01:00:33,277 --> 01:00:36,564
Well, where is he?
- he's here, talking to you.

580
01:00:37,222 --> 01:00:40,903
I get it, he's the talker,
and you're the dumb one.

581
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,058
No, you're the stupid one.
- No, you're the stupid one.

582
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,871
This is the guy who's going to save us?
- Look at him, you're the stupid one.

583
01:00:48,397 --> 01:00:53,392
Disgusting, I love it.
New topic, we are all going to die.

584
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:55,890
Well that's not good.
Stress is a killer.

585
01:00:56,022 --> 01:01:00,360
Let go of your arms and open our minds.
Downward dog.

586
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:05,882
Serious?
- I'm waiting, I have all the time in the world.

587
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:12,719
Actually, you don't have the time in the world.
None of us.

588
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:18,635
See, it's that thing in the sky.
- That blinding light that keeps getting bigger?

589
01:01:18,635 --> 01:01:23,368
What's up with that, this is fine for me.
- With all due respect, Your Bowness.

590
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:28,758
That's an asteroid, it's magnetically
attracted and it's heading our way.

591
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:36,121
It would long for these magnetic
crystals. Well, who can you blame?

592
01:01:36,121 --> 01:01:40,591
Did you know that our soil gives eternal youth?
I'm a 400 year old.

593
01:01:40,854 --> 01:01:44,403
That is not possible.
- that's for sure, I'm 326.

594
01:01:45,455 --> 01:01:48,742
You don't look much older than 275 years old.

595
01:01:48,742 --> 01:01:52,423
We are young, happy and safe.
And we always will be.

596
01:01:52,555 --> 01:01:54,921
Dankzij, Gia topia.

597
01:01:55,184 --> 01:02:00,048
It all looks nice,
but how do we get it into space?

598
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,255
Sorry, you want to destroy our home?
- It will be destroyed anyway.

599
01:02:04,255 --> 01:02:07,937
But if we shoot this magnetic material
into the atmosphere.

600
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:12,144
Can we change the asteroid's orbit
and save everyone? What do you say?

601
01:02:15,036 --> 01:02:17,797
Well, is that a yes, or ?

602
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:23,319
There's a lot of hostility in the small of your back.

603
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:28,052
Shangri Lama how can we...
- Bird dance, bum waving, mashed potatoes.

604
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:33,179
Your flexibility is out of the question.
How are we going to move these devilish crystals?

605
01:02:33,179 --> 01:02:37,255
You can't do that, it's impossible.
I'm tired.

606
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,302
Nice to meet you guys.
Free to hang out, whatever.

607
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,693
That's it, he was our last hope.

608
01:02:48,956 --> 01:02:52,505
We are doomed.
- Yeah, all we got was a free yoga class.

609
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:54,609
On that subject.

610
01:02:55,266 --> 01:02:59,736
Can you help me please?
My nose is dangerously close to my bottom.

611
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:04,338
Why do you have two tails?
- I'm here too.

612
01:03:11,043 --> 01:03:14,198
Do not Cry. Look on the bright side.

613
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:18,011
We see our lives flash before our eyes.

614
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:21,692
It means, I become completely...

615
01:03:21,692 --> 01:03:23,927
in love with you again.

616
01:03:24,190 --> 01:03:28,529
Only you can make the end of the world
appear as a good thing.

617
01:03:33,524 --> 01:03:37,600
We did a good job raising her.
She's stronger than we know.

618
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:41,281
Two days earlier I gave everything
to keep her with us.

619
01:03:41,281 --> 01:03:45,883
Now I would give anything to see her get married,
leave home.

620
01:03:46,014 --> 01:03:49,038
Playing with her children, dancing with her husband.

621
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:52,456
Yelling at him when
he forgets their anniversary.

622
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:56,400
It was a good one, wasn't it?

623
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:59,424
Our lives, you, me and Peaches.

624
01:03:59,687 --> 01:04:00,870
Best.

625
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:11,520
Brooke, you are so free.
- You're taking away my lisp.

626
01:04:12,177 --> 01:04:15,595
I bet you say that to all the girls.
- I'm trying.

627
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:21,117
But usually they run away too quickly.
- Oh, you're so romantic.

628
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:25,850
I know this is going to sound super fast,
but...

629
01:04:25,981 --> 01:04:28,742
Do you want to be my partner forever?

630
01:04:29,268 --> 01:04:32,949
I do not know what to say.
We've only known each other for twelve minutes.

631
01:04:33,212 --> 01:04:35,842
Where are you staying so long? Yes!

632
01:04:35,973 --> 01:04:38,866
This is my best last day on earth ever.

633
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:42,941
A diamond, I need a diamond.
Where can I find one?

634
01:04:43,467 --> 01:04:44,650
Perfect.

635
01:04:45,702 --> 01:04:49,252
No, Sid, honey, don't do this.
- Nonsense.

636
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:51,224
Only the best for my...

637
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:52,933
ware...

638
01:04:53,590 --> 01:04:54,642
love.

639
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:12,128
Oopsie.
- No, oh simple mega shit.

640
01:05:12,128 --> 01:05:16,992
Are you talking to her or me?
- This wall was one thing that kept us young.

641
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:18,833
Now we are all doomed.

642
01:05:21,331 --> 01:05:25,406
And now I'm in your debt, I guess.
Thank you very much, dumbass.

643
01:05:25,932 --> 01:05:29,351
Calm down you Lama.
This is the duke of my dreams.

644
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:33,163
He meant well.
- Oh he meant well, who cares?

645
01:05:33,558 --> 01:05:37,239
So much frustration.
- Three hundred years of peace and harmony

646
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:39,868
undone by one caste robbery,

647
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:44,996
an incredible, stupid floss.

648
01:05:58,143 --> 01:06:01,430
You boys are old.
What we had is done.

649
01:06:01,692 --> 01:06:06,425
That's what happens when you date a cougar.
- I'm very sorry Mr. Lama.

650
01:06:09,318 --> 01:06:12,079
Sorry, you don't fix anything.
you little...

651
01:06:14,051 --> 01:06:18,915
I need a bubble bath or a massage.
I need to get out some anger.

652
01:06:19,047 --> 01:06:22,202
Let it out!
Why does it take so long?

653
01:06:24,306 --> 01:06:25,883
I want to hit something.

654
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:30,090
That is it.
Squeeze the energy.

655
01:06:30,222 --> 01:06:33,640
The Earth's most powerful
propulsion device is right in front of us.

656
01:06:33,903 --> 01:06:36,006
Who, spitting magic here?

657
01:06:37,716 --> 01:06:41,134
The volcano, that kind of magma.

658
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:44,684
All we have to do
is close off the steam beds.

659
01:06:45,472 --> 01:06:48,102
That's a crazy plan.
- You're a crazy plan.

660
01:06:48,233 --> 01:06:51,389
That doesn't even make sense.
- What are you, a professor of logic?

661
01:06:51,389 --> 01:06:55,070
Professor of Kitty whiskas of the universe
yum, yum, yum?

662
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:59,408
You see? Dramatic suppression
releases dramatic bursts.

663
01:06:59,934 --> 01:07:02,564
And you call yourself a professor.

664
01:07:03,221 --> 01:07:07,297
Okay, we need all the crystals
to throw into the volcano right now.

665
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,898
I don't give my crystals.
We need them to rebuild our sensation.

666
01:07:14,922 --> 01:07:17,946
May I remind you
geotopia is not your right to keep.

667
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,970
No, you can't!
- It came from the sky

668
01:07:21,101 --> 01:07:22,942
and it's time to give it back.

669
01:07:22,942 --> 01:07:25,571
Not true.
- Well, you old goat.

670
01:07:25,703 --> 01:07:30,830
Change is not easy, but it is part of
life. It's time to embrace that.

671
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:34,117
Whether you like it or not.
- Not.

672
01:07:34,117 --> 01:07:39,376
Listen lama, I'm not going to lick your hole.
So you get on board

673
01:07:39,507 --> 01:07:43,451
or turn yourself into a pretzel
and stay out of our way.

674
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:47,921
Come on everybody.
Let's take all the crystals you find.

675
01:07:48,841 --> 01:07:52,260
And remember, lift with your legs.

676
01:07:52,391 --> 01:07:53,574
Too late.

677
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:59,228
Listen planet defense team.
Step one.

678
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:03,303
Build pressure within the volcano by
closing geysers.

679
01:08:03,303 --> 01:08:08,168
No steam should escape.
If there is a leak, the pressure is weak.

680
01:08:13,427 --> 01:08:18,028
Step two. Make sure the largest magnetic
crystals are in the volcano.

681
01:08:18,028 --> 01:08:22,367
They have to go high into the sky to
deviate the asteroid from its course.

682
01:08:29,598 --> 01:08:33,542
Okay six soufflés, say the asteroid
dada.

683
01:08:34,199 --> 01:08:36,303
#Asteroid.
- #What does Hashtag mean?

684
01:08:36,434 --> 01:08:38,932
#That's how you make something cool.
- #That's what I say.

685
01:08:39,063 --> 01:08:41,430
#I am done.

686
01:08:43,139 --> 01:08:47,872
This is it friends, throw in the hole,
every crystal counts.

687
01:08:57,864 --> 01:09:01,414
Good news everyone, we're six minutes ahead of
schedule.

688
01:09:02,202 --> 01:09:04,832
Someone up there likes us.

689
01:09:29,285 --> 01:09:34,939
Bad news, someone up there does
n't like us. We're six minutes behind.

690
01:09:35,333 --> 01:09:39,014
Double pace everyone.
We need that big crystal.

691
01:09:58,998 --> 01:10:02,285
We have company.
- I'm preparing a lunch cake.

692
01:10:09,384 --> 01:10:12,671
To wait.

693
01:10:14,512 --> 01:10:17,930
I'm sorry for this. I'm really conflicted right now.

694
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:24,372
That's more what I like, Roger.
Finish him off now.

695
01:10:24,503 --> 01:10:27,264
Wait, you don't understand.
Do you see this?

696
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:31,866
If that asteroid hits, we're all going to die.
- If it hits, we'll all die.

697
01:10:33,706 --> 01:10:37,519
You're wrong there.
While you run for your lives.

698
01:10:37,519 --> 01:10:42,383
We are high in the sky, floating above everything.

699
01:10:42,909 --> 01:10:46,065
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

700
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:49,351
We will be safe like all those birds there.

701
01:10:50,535 --> 01:10:51,849
Coincidence hit.

702
01:10:53,427 --> 01:10:55,399
Very much a coincidence?

703
01:10:56,977 --> 01:11:00,395
I knew it, I was right.
There is no paradise.

704
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:03,287
What? I'm too young to go.

705
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:08,283
She gets it. Now please,
we don't have much time.

706
01:11:08,941 --> 01:11:13,674
What are you waiting for? Kill him.
- No, Dad. I won't allow it.

707
01:11:13,674 --> 01:11:18,144
Do you know why I love this family?
Because we are alive.

708
01:11:18,275 --> 01:11:21,167
There are much more important things now than your pride.

709
01:11:21,299 --> 01:11:26,952
If you care about us, you shouldn't
kill him. You were supposed to help him, Dad.

710
01:11:27,610 --> 01:11:31,685
I hate to say this, but my petulant
little brother might be right.

711
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:35,235
As a father, I would be working with
my worst enemy.

712
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:39,311
To ensure the future
for my little one.

713
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,828
Reinforcements have arrived.

714
01:11:57,059 --> 01:11:59,951
Okay, Roger. Lead us the way.

715
01:12:05,342 --> 01:12:07,971
That's what a cheering crowd sounds like.

716
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:13,493
Keep it up dinosaurs use that
Jurassic super power.

717
01:12:26,246 --> 01:12:27,560
Watch out, guys!

718
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:39,393
The weasel has landed.

719
01:12:40,708 --> 01:12:43,600
I push it in.
Join Peaches and Ellie.

720
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:50,436
No. I'm not leaving you.
We do this together.

721
01:12:55,958 --> 01:12:57,010
Where are they?

722
01:12:59,114 --> 01:13:01,874
We have to get everyone away from the volcano .

723
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,950
Folks, I don't have any cake anymore, but I have salami.
- Faster, faster!

724
01:13:06,082 --> 01:13:08,974
I have good salami.
- Grandma, come on!

725
01:13:16,336 --> 01:13:19,097
This will not work ....

726
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,962
Air jump in the halfpipe.

727
01:13:23,962 --> 01:13:27,117
I have a plan.
We have to let go of the crystal.

728
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:30,798
You know we're trying to
get him into the volcano.

729
01:13:30,930 --> 01:13:35,663
All I want is a life with Peaches.
And prove myself to you.

730
01:13:35,663 --> 01:13:38,555
Well okay, two things.
I want two things.

731
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:42,631
Do you really think I
want to throw away the only chance we have?

732
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,758
Let's do it.
- On my signal.

733
01:13:47,758 --> 01:13:48,941
A.

734
01:13:48,941 --> 01:13:49,993
Two.

735
01:13:50,124 --> 01:13:51,176
Three!

736
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,718
What are they doing now?

737
01:14:22,072 --> 01:14:23,650
Did it work?

738
01:14:31,143 --> 01:14:33,904
I take back everything I ever said about you.

739
01:14:34,562 --> 01:14:35,876
Wait, what?

740
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:41,267
Let's leave.

741
01:15:03,617 --> 01:15:07,561
What happened?
- Maybe the calm before the storm.

742
01:16:02,647 --> 01:16:05,014
We did it.

743
01:16:09,221 --> 01:16:12,376
In your face space stone.
- Yes, honey.

744
01:16:18,555 --> 01:16:20,527
Dude, not on the mouth.

745
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:25,260
Get out you stupid block,
we stopped the doomsday clock.

746
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:31,702
Bring it in, brother son.
Welcome to the family.

747
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:38,013
And you, you coconut.

748
01:16:38,276 --> 01:16:40,380
I will never doubt you again.

749
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:44,981
You see? Dad is always right.
Remember that for later when you grow up.

750
01:16:51,555 --> 01:16:55,893
Are you really not coming with us?
- Sidney, I wish I could.

751
01:16:56,288 --> 01:16:58,786
But we both know
this is for the best.

752
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:04,176
You have your whole life ahead of you.
Besides, I have Grandma to keep me company.

753
01:17:04,833 --> 01:17:09,172
You're staying too?
- Are you joking? This place is great.

754
01:17:09,566 --> 01:17:14,299
Tonight it's the big talent show
and tomorrow it's bingo.

755
01:17:14,431 --> 01:17:17,849
I'm not getting any younger!
- What, I can't hear you.

756
01:17:17,849 --> 01:17:21,793
What? I can not hear you.
- What, I can't hear you.

757
01:17:22,187 --> 01:17:25,606
You will always be my one true love.

758
01:17:25,737 --> 01:17:26,920
Here.

759
01:17:29,944 --> 01:17:31,390
Wait a second.

760
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:40,330
It looks just like you.
- Now we will be together forever.

761
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:48,219
Goodbye, handsome.
- Hi, Sydney.

762
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,310
What you need is more fizz.
- he is right.

763
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:15,959
Shangri Lama is back home, baby.

764
01:18:21,744 --> 01:18:22,927
Yours?

765
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:27,397
Hello teddy bear.

766
01:18:30,552 --> 01:18:33,971
The hot tub just got a lot warmer.

767
01:18:34,891 --> 01:18:39,098
Great, it's like a
fountain of eternal youth.

768
01:18:39,492 --> 01:18:42,516
We'll think of a name for it later.

769
01:18:56,058 --> 01:19:00,133
Where is the bride? Why is there no bride?
- Because you're talking into a branch.

770
01:19:00,265 --> 01:19:03,815
Mom, I can't talk, I'm at a wedding.
- What do you mean you can't talk, where are you?

771
01:19:03,815 --> 01:19:08,679
Excuse me, is it true?
You saved the world from an asteroid?

772
01:19:10,388 --> 01:19:15,253
It's a very scary story, can you handle it?
- Yes.

773
01:19:15,779 --> 01:19:19,197
How scary?
- Well we were...

774
01:19:19,854 --> 01:19:24,061
It was five minutes to twelve.
And there was a volcano eruption, dinosaur birds

775
01:19:24,061 --> 01:19:27,874
and the end of the world.
- And the zombies, don't forget the zombies.

776
01:19:27,874 --> 01:19:31,161
You know, we'd be good parents.

777
01:19:31,292 --> 01:19:34,185
So, I looked at bigfoot and I said, listen...

778
01:19:34,842 --> 01:19:38,129
Don't know. What should I do?

779
01:19:38,129 --> 01:19:41,678
Honey, listen to me. This is normal, okay?

780
01:19:41,678 --> 01:19:44,439
Everyone is nervous.
- What is going on? What is happening?

781
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:48,778
It's right... I can't go.
How can I go?

782
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,144
I don't want to leave you.

783
01:19:54,825 --> 01:19:56,929
Hey, fluff ball.

784
01:19:57,192 --> 01:19:59,690
Do you remember the first time we
played hockey?

785
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:03,371
You were so scared on the ice
because it was so slippery.

786
01:20:03,897 --> 01:20:06,921
Remember how I held you
when you started skating?

787
01:20:06,921 --> 01:20:10,602
And when I knew you
were ready, I let you go.

788
01:20:12,180 --> 01:20:15,466
I know you're ready.
Now you have to let it go.

789
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:20,857
I always knew you would find someone
who suits you. And you found him.

790
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:22,697
The way I did it.

791
01:20:22,697 --> 01:20:26,904
It's your time, honey.
See the world, pursue your dreams.

792
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:32,032
And when you ever decide to come back.
We will be here for you. Okay?

793
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:23,831
Will you take Julian as your husband?
- I will.

794
01:21:23,963 --> 01:21:26,724
Will you take Peaches to be your wife?
- Very sure.

795
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,011
Then I now pronounce you man and wife.

796
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:06,034
That's incredible, you're young again.
Anyway, I'm still single.

797
01:22:06,034 --> 01:22:10,504
I think the universe was smiling at us.
- I have so many questions for you.

798
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:14,053
What happened? How did you find me?
Have you tried the shrimp?

799
01:22:14,711 --> 01:22:17,866
Just close that cute
little mouth of yours and listen.

800
01:22:18,655 --> 01:22:22,468
This is dedicated to the
love of my dreams.

801
01:22:22,599 --> 01:22:24,703
This guy? Are you serious?

802
01:23:24,259 --> 01:23:28,598
I thought I'd never say it, but
beautiful work on this wedding.

803
01:23:28,598 --> 01:23:31,096
Certainly. Here's my bill.

804
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:33,462
What?
- Follow the wedding cake before the wedding.

805
01:23:33,594 --> 01:23:36,749
It's a tradition that I just invented.
- Wait a minute, this is ridiculous.

806
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,904
Look what you charge for flowers.
- Flowers are expensive.

807
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:44,374
No! They are free. We are in a forest.
This bill is ridiculous.

808
01:23:54,366 --> 01:23:59,756
Mars, the red planet.
Cold, dry.

809
01:23:59,888 --> 01:24:04,884
Impossible to live on.
But billions of years ago.

810
01:24:04,884 --> 01:24:07,776
Mars looked like this.

811
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:11,852
There were lakes, rivers, oceans

812
01:24:11,983 --> 01:24:15,138
the perfect condition to form a life.

813
01:24:15,138 --> 01:24:16,190
We...

814
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:21,318
What happened? Why was life
not able to succeed in it.

815
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,891
Where did the water go?

816
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,915
We will never know.

817
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:39,915
PLEASE NOTE, NOW THERE'S ANOTHER NICE PART TO COME!

1463
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,240
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would make it out</i>

1464
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,471
<i>And come this far
Oh I never knew I</i>

1465
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,028
<i>Would see the day
We come together</i>

1466
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:04,712
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before</i>

1467
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,876
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

1468
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,035
<i>You</i>

1469
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:10,037
<i>You make me happy</i>

1470
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,116
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

1471
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,237
<i>You make my world
a better place</i>

1472
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:16,360
<i>You</i>

1473
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,959
<i>You are my rainbow</i>

1474
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,952
<i>You color my day so bright</i>

1475
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:24,077
<i>I wanna stay forever
with my superstar</i>

1476
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:25,200
<i>My superstar</i>

1477
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,117
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

1478
01:25:27,200 --> 01:25:29,236
<i>My superstar
My superstar</i>

1479
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,749
<i>You shine so bright
Into my heart</i>

1480
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:35,919
<i>My love, my love, my love</i>

1481
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:39,669
<i>You're shining
into my heart, heart</i>

1482
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:34,990
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would have it all</i>

1483
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:36,473
<i>Would have it all</i>

1484
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:39,068
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would feel so good</i>

1485
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:40,639
<i>Would feel the full</i>

1486
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:43,274
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would live the dream</i>

1487
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:44,628
<i>It's so, so real</i>

1488
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,314
<i>Oh I never knew I
Would see the day</i>

1489
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:48,919
<i>We'd come together</i>

1490
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:53,232
<i>Oh, it's not like anything
I've ever felt before</i>

1491
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:56,915
<i>Before, before</i>

1492
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:58,035
<i>You</i>

1493
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,792
<i>You make me happy</i>

1494
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,876
<i>You keep me laughing</i>

1495
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:04,997

Yeah, yeah</i>

1510
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,069
<i>You</i>

1511
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,037
