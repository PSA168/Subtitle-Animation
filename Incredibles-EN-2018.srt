1
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,100
File 82-712.

2
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,269
Agent Rick Dicker interrogating.

3
00:00:57,271 --> 00:00:58,640
State your name, please.

4
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,646
Uh, Tony. Tony Rydinger.

5
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:09,281
Tell me about the incident.

6
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:12,518
Well, there's this girl,
um, in my class.

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,152
<i>I saw her at the track meet.</i>

8
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:16,789
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

9
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:18,824
<i>I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.</i>

10
00:01:18,826 --> 00:01:21,159
<i>Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.</i>

11
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:22,427
<i>Cool, cute.</i>

12
00:01:22,429 --> 00:01:23,763
<i>I asked her out to a movie.</i>

13
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:24,830
So, Friday?

14
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,431
- Friday.
- Friday.

15
00:01:26,433 --> 00:01:27,800
<i>And I went to watch
the track meet.</i>

16
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:31,604
<i>Not long after, this thing
happened in the parking lot.</i>

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,521
Behold! The Underminer!

18
00:01:48,523 --> 00:01:53,358
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,193
<i>As if things aren't
weird enough,</i>

20
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:56,729
<i>I look over
and I see these boots.</i>

21
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:58,296
You two, stay here.

22
00:01:58,298 --> 00:01:59,765
Wait. Should we be doing this?

23
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:01,333
It is still illegal.

24
00:02:01,335 --> 00:02:02,602
<i>They looked like superheroes.</i>

25
00:02:02,604 --> 00:02:04,369
- We're gonna lose him.
- Oh, all right.

26
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,571
One of you patrol the perimeter,

27
00:02:05,573 --> 00:02:06,839
keep the crowds back and safe.

28
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,406
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

29
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:09,307
But I thought we were
gonna go with...

30
00:02:09,309 --> 00:02:10,342
You heard your mother.

31
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:12,212
Trampoline me.

32
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:18,350
I call perimeter!

33
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:19,451
You're not going anywhere,

34
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:20,886
you little maggoty creep!

35
00:02:20,888 --> 00:02:22,722
<i>I see my chance
to get out of there.</i>

36
00:02:22,724 --> 00:02:26,257
<i>But there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.</i>

37
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:27,793
<i>The girl, she's upset</i>

38
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,662
<i>and she throws down her mask...</i>

39
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:31,229
<i>and it's her!</i>

40
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,698
Oh. Tony!

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,699
Hi.

42
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:35,635
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

43
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:37,369
<i>It was just getting too freaky.</i>

44
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:39,404
<i>I couldn't handle it
and ran off.</i>

45
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:40,806
I feel kinda bad about it.

46
00:02:40,808 --> 00:02:43,676
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

47
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:45,778
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

48
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,780
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

49
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,348
I'm pretty secure manhood-wise.

50
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,684
What is that?

51
00:02:51,686 --> 00:02:54,419
Have you told anyone else
about this? Your parents?

52
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,388
No, they'd only think
I was hiding something.

53
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,658
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, kid.

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,392
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker.

55
00:03:00,394 --> 00:03:02,394
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

56
00:03:02,396 --> 00:03:05,798
Now, things are just
gonna be weird.

57
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,466
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

58
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,871
You will, kid.

59
00:03:10,672 --> 00:03:12,507
You will.

60
00:03:24,686 --> 00:03:26,418
Come on!

61
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:48,007
Consider yourself undermined!

62
00:03:59,987 --> 00:04:02,690
Ooh.

63
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:13,999
- Underminer!
- We meet again... Huh?

64
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,876
Oh, great!
Now, he's on the agenda.

65
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:38,958
Incredible!

66
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,458
Meet Jack Hammer!

67
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Buh-bye!

68
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:10,089
No, no, no! No, no, no!

69
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,899
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

70
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,503
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

71
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,375
I can't steer it or stop it.
And the Underminer's escaped!

72
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:32,479
We'll have to stop it...
Bob! The monorail!

73
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,556
Frozone! Yeah!

74
00:05:46,093 --> 00:05:47,458
We have to stop this thing

75
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,694
before it gets to the overpass!

76
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:51,030
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

77
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,844
Hey, lady!

78
00:06:04,444 --> 00:06:06,178
Thank you so much, young man!

79
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,654
What?

80
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:15,455
Violet!

81
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,528
Ahh!

82
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,170
Stop!

83
00:06:31,172 --> 00:06:33,074
Everybody, stop!

84
00:07:02,637 --> 00:07:04,639
- Heads up, Dad!
- Dash!

85
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:09,474
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

86
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:10,976
Dash is watching him!

87
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:12,513
Violet, here, you take him!

88
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,822
It's headed for City Hall!

89
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:26,861
Mom needs help!

90
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:33,766
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

91
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:35,937
Follow them, follow Frozone!

92
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:52,820
Bob! Help me with the boiler!

93
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:10,803
That should do it!

94
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:12,805
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

95
00:08:12,807 --> 00:08:14,206
This thing's gonna blow!

96
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,910
There's no time!

97
00:08:27,722 --> 00:08:29,722
We did it!

98
00:08:29,724 --> 00:08:31,156
Freeze, Supers!

99
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:33,728
Oh, what did we do?

100
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,134
Excuse me, Mr. Zone?

101
00:08:42,036 --> 00:08:45,204
Sorry, but I'm not
really supposed to be here.

102
00:08:45,206 --> 00:08:47,106
Which seems wrong...

103
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:48,207
doesn't it?

104
00:08:48,209 --> 00:08:52,046
Perhaps you'd be interested
in changing that law?

105
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,180
<i>Superheroes including Frozone,</i>

106
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,049
<i>Mr. Incredible,
and Elastigirl...</i>

107
00:08:57,051 --> 00:08:59,218
<i>caused further damage
to the city.</i>

108
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,720
<i>The Underminer remains at large.</i>

109
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,589
We didn't start this fight.

110
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,990
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

111
00:09:04,992 --> 00:09:07,126
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

112
00:09:07,128 --> 00:09:08,060
No.

113
00:09:08,062 --> 00:09:09,695
Did you stop him
from robbing the banks?

114
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:11,163
- No.
- Did you catch him?

115
00:09:11,165 --> 00:09:13,665
- No.
- The banks were insured.

116
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:14,933
We have infrastructure in place

117
00:09:14,935 --> 00:09:16,168
to deal with these matters.

118
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,970
If you had simply
done nothing...

119
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:19,638
everything would now be

120
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,939
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

121
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:23,375
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

122
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,079
Without a doubt.

123
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,783
You weren't much help.

124
00:09:30,785 --> 00:09:32,818
Do you want out of the hole?

125
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,990
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

126
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:40,928
Well, that went poorly.

127
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:43,796
Dad, this is probably

128
00:09:43,798 --> 00:09:47,066
not the best time
to tell you about this...

129
00:09:47,068 --> 00:09:50,137
but something else
happened today with a kid...

130
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:53,040
and my mask.

131
00:10:06,353 --> 00:10:07,853
Oh, hey, Rick.

132
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:10,222
Violet thinks a friend
of hers, a kid named Tony...

133
00:10:10,224 --> 00:10:13,192
might have seen her in the
outfit, without her mask.

134
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:15,360
- Talkative type?
- Don't know.

135
00:10:15,362 --> 00:10:16,829
Last name is Rydinger.

136
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:19,164
Tony Rydinger.

137
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:20,833
I'll check it out.

138
00:10:20,835 --> 00:10:22,334
Bob, Helen...

139
00:10:22,336 --> 00:10:24,970
a word if you don't mind.

140
00:10:24,972 --> 00:10:27,973
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

141
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,408
What?

142
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,110
Politicians don't
understand people...

143
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:34,446
who do good simply
because it's right.

144
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:36,148
It makes 'em nervous.

145
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,984
They've been gunning
for Supers for years.

146
00:10:38,986 --> 00:10:41,386
Today was all they needed.

147
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:43,288
Anyway...

148
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,857
I'm done.

149
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:46,825
I'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel

150
00:10:46,827 --> 00:10:48,260
is the best I can do for ya.

151
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,394
It ain't much.

152
00:10:49,396 --> 00:10:50,729
You've done plenty, Rick.

153
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:52,231
We won't forget.

154
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,466
Well, it has been a great honor

155
00:10:54,468 --> 00:10:56,001
working with you good people.

156
00:10:56,003 --> 00:10:58,470
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

157
00:10:58,472 --> 00:11:01,008
Yeah. You, too.

158
00:11:15,222 --> 00:11:17,091
Did you wash your hands?

159
00:11:18,225 --> 00:11:20,961
With soap?

160
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,331
Did you dry them?

161
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:32,871
What? Is this all vegetables?
Who ordered all vegetables?

162
00:11:32,873 --> 00:11:35,040
I did. They're good and
you're going to have some.

163
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:38,911
Are we going to talk about it?

164
00:11:38,913 --> 00:11:41,146
- What?
- The elephant in the room.

165
00:11:41,148 --> 00:11:43,782
- What elephant?
- I guess not then.

166
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:44,983
You're referring to today.

167
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:46,785
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

168
00:11:46,787 --> 00:11:48,187
We all made mistakes.

169
00:11:48,189 --> 00:11:49,154
For example,

170
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:51,190
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

171
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:54,426
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

172
00:11:54,428 --> 00:11:56,195
We talked about this.

173
00:11:56,197 --> 00:11:57,462
You're not old enough to
decide about these things.

174
00:11:57,464 --> 00:11:58,830
We are old enough to help out.

175
00:11:58,832 --> 00:11:59,932
Yeah!

176
00:11:59,934 --> 00:12:01,534
Isn't that what
you tell us, Dad?

177
00:12:01,536 --> 00:12:04,970
Yeah, well, "help out" can
mean many different things.

178
00:12:04,972 --> 00:12:06,772
But we're supposed to help,
if there's trouble.

179
00:12:06,774 --> 00:12:08,140
- Well, yeah, but...
- Aren't you

180
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:09,841
- glad we helped today?
- Yeah, I know but...

181
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:10,943
You said that you were
proud of us.

182
00:12:10,945 --> 00:12:12,844
Well, yeah, I was. Am!

183
00:12:12,846 --> 00:12:14,213
We wanna fight bad guys!

184
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,249
No, you don't!

185
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:19,284
You said things
were different now.

186
00:12:19,286 --> 00:12:21,853
And they were, on the island.

187
00:12:21,855 --> 00:12:23,455
But I didn't mean
that from now on...

188
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:26,225
So now, we've gotta go back
to never using our powers.

189
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:27,527
It defines who I am.

190
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:29,194
We're not saying you have...

191
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:31,363
- What?
- Someone on TV said it.

192
00:12:31,365 --> 00:12:32,965
Can we just eat?

193
00:12:32,967 --> 00:12:35,834
The dinner, while it's hot?

194
00:12:35,836 --> 00:12:37,402
Did we do something wrong?

195
00:12:37,404 --> 00:12:38,904
- Yes.
- No.

196
00:12:38,906 --> 00:12:41,173
We didn't do anything wrong.

197
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:43,408
Superheroes are illegal.

198
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:45,377
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

199
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:48,514
The law should be fair. What
are we teaching our kids?

200
00:12:48,516 --> 00:12:49,848
To respect the law!

201
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,250
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

202
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:54,086
If laws are unjust, there
are laws to change them!

203
00:12:54,088 --> 00:12:55,254
Otherwise, it's chaos!

204
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,358
Which is exactly what we have!

205
00:13:03,364 --> 00:13:05,364
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

206
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:09,401
- What was?
- Fighting crime as a family.

207
00:13:09,403 --> 00:13:12,538
It was cool.

208
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,575
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

209
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,876
We have to adapt.

210
00:13:17,878 --> 00:13:19,545
Are things bad?

211
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:21,181
Things are fine.

212
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,485
May I be excused?

213
00:13:27,622 --> 00:13:30,623
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

214
00:13:30,625 --> 00:13:33,460
- Uh...
- Not much longer, honey.

215
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:41,967
What are we gonna do?

216
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,869
I don't know.

217
00:13:43,871 --> 00:13:45,370
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

218
00:13:45,372 --> 00:13:46,506
Dicker is done, Bob.

219
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:50,042
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

220
00:13:50,044 --> 00:13:51,644
One of us has gotta get a job.

221
00:13:51,646 --> 00:13:53,045
One of us?

222
00:13:53,047 --> 00:13:55,113
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

223
00:13:55,115 --> 00:13:56,948
Hated every minute of it.

224
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,484
I know it was hard on you.

225
00:13:58,486 --> 00:14:00,319
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

226
00:14:00,321 --> 00:14:01,953
and you take care of the kids...

227
00:14:01,955 --> 00:14:05,457
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

228
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,593
You know where my suit
and ties are?

229
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,027
Burned up when...

230
00:14:09,029 --> 00:14:10,962
The jet destroyed our house.

231
00:14:10,964 --> 00:14:12,331
Yeah.

232
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,067
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

233
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,335
It's just us.

234
00:14:16,337 --> 00:14:17,505
We can't wait for...

235
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,548
No lifeguard on duty!

236
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:30,148
Swim at your own risk.

237
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:31,484
Oh, where'd you go today?

238
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:33,653
I noticed
you missed all the fun.

239
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:36,489
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

240
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:38,190
I'm just as illegal as you guys.

241
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,992
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

242
00:14:40,994 --> 00:14:42,595
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

243
00:14:42,597 --> 00:14:44,229
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

244
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:47,099
I heard the program shut down.

245
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,000
How much longer
are you in this motel?

246
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:50,268
Two weeks.

247
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,070
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

248
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:54,306
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

249
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:56,108
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

250
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,510
Well, door's always open.

251
00:14:57,512 --> 00:15:00,078
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,615
While you guys
were being detained...

253
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:06,451
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

254
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,521
- Winston Deavor.
- Wants to talk...

255
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:12,257
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

256
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:13,493
I checked him out.

257
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,426
He's legit.

258
00:15:14,428 --> 00:15:16,294
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

259
00:15:16,296 --> 00:15:18,430
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

260
00:15:18,432 --> 00:15:20,465
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

261
00:15:20,467 --> 00:15:24,336
- When?
- Tonight. I'm going there now.

262
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,204
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

263
00:15:26,206 --> 00:15:27,640
He wants all three of us.

264
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:31,410
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

265
00:15:31,412 --> 00:15:34,179
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

266
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:36,448
Go in our Supersuits?

267
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,083
Yeah.

268
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:40,352
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

269
00:15:40,354 --> 00:15:43,424
Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

270
00:15:46,994 --> 00:15:48,694
Where are you going?

271
00:15:48,696 --> 00:15:51,363
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

272
00:15:51,365 --> 00:15:52,632
If Jack-Jack wakes up...

273
00:15:52,634 --> 00:15:54,368
I know the drill.

274
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:07,580
Your security badges.
Please, this way.

275
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:09,247
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

276
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:10,348
Good to see you.

277
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm your biggest fan. Shoot!

278
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,045
I love superheroes!

279
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,214
The powers, the costumes...

280
00:16:42,216 --> 00:16:44,049
the mythic struggles.

281
00:16:44,051 --> 00:16:46,151
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

282
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,419
Genuine pleasure to meet you.

283
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:49,221
- Frozone!
- It's good to see you.

284
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:50,556
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

285
00:16:50,558 --> 00:16:52,725
- Mr. Incredible!

294

Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this...

295
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:20,753
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

296
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:22,655
...is my tardy sister, Evelyn.

297
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:26,592
And I'm scolding myself so
you don't have to, Winston!

298
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:28,126
Spectacular.

299
00:17:28,128 --> 00:17:30,195
My father was so proud

300
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:33,331
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

301
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,535
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

302
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,503
He was your top supporter.

303
00:17:37,505 --> 00:17:40,138
He donated to superhero causes.

304
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,406
<i>He raised money</i>

305
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,308
<i>for the Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.</i>

306
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,310
<i>He got to know
many Supers personally.</i>

307
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:46,812
<i>Even installed a phone</i>

308
00:17:46,814 --> 00:17:50,181
<i>with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...</i>

309
00:17:50,183 --> 00:17:51,584
<i>in case of emergencies.</i>

310
00:17:51,586 --> 00:17:54,319
<i>He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.</i>

311
00:17:54,321 --> 00:17:55,555
He was heartbroken

312
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:57,289
when you were all forced
to go underground.

313
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,691
Father believed the world

314
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:00,695
would become more dangerous
without you.

315
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:04,298
He didn't know how right he was.

316
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:06,632
<i>There was a break-in.</i>

317
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,803
<i>My father called Gazerbeam.</i>

318
00:18:10,805 --> 00:18:12,437
<i>The direct line.</i>

319
00:18:12,439 --> 00:18:14,172
<i>No answer.</i>

320
00:18:14,174 --> 00:18:16,842
<i>He called Fironic, no answer.</i>

321
00:18:16,844 --> 00:18:20,145
<i>Superheroes had just been
made illegal...</i>

322
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,347
<i>The robbers discovered him
on the phone...</i>

323
00:18:22,349 --> 00:18:23,718
<i>and shot him.</i>

324
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,620
So...

325
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:28,888
It must've been hard.

326
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,489
Especially for Mother.

327
00:18:30,491 --> 00:18:33,659
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

328
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:36,529
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

329
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:37,797
it never would've happened.

330
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,398
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

331
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,734
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

332
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,268
I disagree strongly!

333
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:45,405
But we're not going
into it right now.

334
00:18:46,306 --> 00:18:47,405
The point is...

335
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:49,307
nobody expected us

336
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,744
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

337
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:55,481
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

338
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,950
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

339
00:18:57,952 --> 00:18:59,585
into what it is today.

340
00:18:59,587 --> 00:19:02,354
A world-class
telecommunications company.

341
00:19:02,356 --> 00:19:03,756
Bigger than ever.

342
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:06,859
Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.

343
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:08,628
Hence, this meeting.

344
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,362
Let me ask you something.

345
00:19:10,364 --> 00:19:12,197
What is the main reason

346
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,766
you were all forced underground?

347
00:19:13,768 --> 00:19:15,835
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

348
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:18,370
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

349
00:19:18,372 --> 00:19:19,805
Difficult situation.

350
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:22,207
You were faced with a
lot of hard decisions.

351
00:19:22,209 --> 00:19:23,375
Oh, tell me about it.

352
00:19:23,377 --> 00:19:24,610
I can't.

353
00:19:24,612 --> 00:19:27,278
Because I didn't see it...

354
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,881
neither did anyone else.

355
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,282
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

356
00:19:31,284 --> 00:19:33,919
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

357
00:19:33,921 --> 00:19:36,522
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

358
00:19:36,524 --> 00:19:39,424
They see destruction
and they see you.

359
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,826
So, if we wanna change

360
00:19:40,828 --> 00:19:43,629
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

361
00:19:43,631 --> 00:19:44,597
we need you

362
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:46,966
to share your perceptions
with the world.

363
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,267
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

364
00:19:49,269 --> 00:19:53,405
<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i>

365
00:19:53,407 --> 00:19:54,640
<i>How do we do that?</i>

366
00:19:54,642 --> 00:19:56,842
We embed
tiny cameras, like those,

367
00:19:56,844 --> 00:19:58,276
into your Supersuits.

368
00:19:58,278 --> 00:19:59,477
Wow, so small.

369
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,980
And the picture is outstanding.

370
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,748
Thanks! Designed 'em myself.

371
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,349
We've got resources, lobbyists,

372
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,685
worldwide connections...

373
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,253
and very important, insurance.

374
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:09,555
Insurance is key.

375
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,957
All we need now are the
super-est superheroes.

376
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:14,426
It needs you three. Come on!

377
00:20:14,428 --> 00:20:17,797
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

378
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,898
This sounds great!

379
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,366
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

380
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:23,435
That enthusiasm is golden.

381
00:20:23,437 --> 00:20:25,705
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

382
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,474
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

383
00:20:29,476 --> 00:20:32,312
Better than me?

384
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:34,513
I mean, she's good.

385
00:20:34,515 --> 00:20:36,615
Really, a credit to her...

386
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:39,485
You know. You know.

387
00:20:39,487 --> 00:20:40,786
With great respect...

388
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:41,787
let's not test the whole

389
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:43,689
"insurance-will-pay-
for-everything" idea...

390
00:20:43,691 --> 00:20:45,891
on the first go 'round, okay?

391
00:20:45,893 --> 00:20:49,595
Wait a minute. You're saying what?
I'm messy?

392
00:20:49,597 --> 00:20:51,630
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

393
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:53,999
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

394
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:55,701
before going underground.

395
00:20:55,703 --> 00:20:57,703
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

396
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:59,739
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

397
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,575
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

398
00:21:02,577 --> 00:21:04,342
Of course! We're gonna solve

399
00:21:04,344 --> 00:21:06,411
all kinds of problems together.

400
00:21:06,413 --> 00:21:10,818
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

401
00:21:11,552 --> 00:21:13,986
So, what do you say?

402
00:21:13,988 --> 00:21:16,557
What do I say?

403
00:21:17,357 --> 00:21:19,558
I don't know.

404
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,326
What do you mean,
you don't know?

405
00:21:21,328 --> 00:21:23,662
A few hours ago, you were
saying it was over...

406
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,865
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

407
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,967
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

408
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:29,635
and you don't know?

409
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:32,805
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

410
00:21:32,807 --> 00:21:34,372
So do I.

411
00:21:34,374 --> 00:21:35,908
From jail, Bob!

412
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,475
And how do you do that?

413
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,645
By turning down a chance
to change the law

414
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,046
that forces them to hide
what they are?

415
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:43,682
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

416
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:46,018
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

417
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,654
whether they decide to
use those powers or not.

418
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:50,022
This will benefit them.

419
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,824
It's not a good time to be away.

420
00:21:51,826 --> 00:21:53,592
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

421
00:21:53,594 --> 00:21:55,494
Vi is worried
about her first date

422
00:21:55,496 --> 00:21:56,929
with that boy she likes, Tony...

423
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:57,730
and Jack-Jack...

424
00:21:57,732 --> 00:22:00,699
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

425
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,001
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

426
00:22:02,003 --> 00:22:04,770
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

427
00:22:04,772 --> 00:22:06,605
I'm just not sure I can leave.

428
00:22:06,607 --> 00:22:08,040
Of course you can leave.

429
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:10,142
You've got to. So that I...

430
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:12,077
we can be Supers again,

431
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,879
so our kids can have
that choice.

432
00:22:13,881 --> 00:22:15,948
So you can have that choice.

433
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,149
All right, yes!

434
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,718
So I can have that choice.

435
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,054
And I would do a great job!

436
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:26,826
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever...

437
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,794
But they want you.

438
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,666
And you'll do a great...

439
00:22:32,432 --> 00:22:33,768
job...

440
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:36,936
too.

441
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,972
Well, that
was excruciating to watch.

442
00:22:39,974 --> 00:22:42,007
I can't lie to you.

443
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,476
It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...

444
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,545
But what's the choice?

445
00:22:46,547 --> 00:22:47,847
One, do this right,

446
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:49,447
get well paid,
we're out of the motel...

447
00:22:49,449 --> 00:22:51,050
and things get better
for all Supers,

448
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,450
including our kids.

449
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,919
Or two...

450
00:22:53,921 --> 00:22:57,455
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

451
00:22:57,457 --> 00:22:58,924
You know it's crazy, right?

452
00:22:58,926 --> 00:23:01,459
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

453
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:02,561
To fix the law,
I gotta break it.

454
00:23:02,563 --> 00:23:03,662
You'll be great.

455
00:23:03,664 --> 00:23:04,830
I know I will.

456
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:05,898
But what about you?
We have kids.

457
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,700
I'll watch the kids, no problem.

458
00:23:07,702 --> 00:23:09,467
- Easy.
- Easy, huh?

459
00:23:09,469 --> 00:23:10,936
You're adorable.

460
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,470
Well, if there is a problem,

461
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:13,606
I'll drop this thing
and come right back.

462
00:23:13,608 --> 00:23:14,840
You won't need to.

463
00:23:14,842 --> 00:23:17,011
I got it, you go do this thing.

464
00:23:17,812 --> 00:23:19,745
Do it so...

465
00:23:19,747 --> 00:23:22,447
I can do it better.

466
00:23:22,449 --> 00:23:24,617
Deavor here.

467
00:23:24,619 --> 00:23:26,051
This is Elastigirl.

468
00:23:26,053 --> 00:23:27,088
I'm in.

469
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,192
Mr. Deavor, it's wonderful...

470
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,793
<i>but it's too generous.</i>

471
00:23:34,795 --> 00:23:36,228
Nonsense! That's the
least we can do.

472
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,763
We're partners now!

473
00:23:37,765 --> 00:23:39,732
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

474
00:23:39,734 --> 00:23:42,101
But whose house? Is it a house?

475
00:23:42,103 --> 00:23:44,003
<i>It's my house. I have several.</i>

476
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,572
<i>I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.</i>

477
00:23:46,574 --> 00:23:48,140
I don't know what to say.

478
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,511
How about "thanks"?

479
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:53,078
This is our new house?

480
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,582
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

481
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,651
This is homey.

482
00:23:58,653 --> 00:23:59,985
Look at this place.

483
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:02,688
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire...

484
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,189
who liked to come and go
without being seen...

485
00:24:04,191 --> 00:24:06,859
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

486
00:24:06,861 --> 00:24:08,527
Good thing we won't stand out.

487
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:11,664
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

488
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,699
It's got a big yard!

489
00:24:13,701 --> 00:24:15,935
Isn't this a bit much?

490
00:24:15,937 --> 00:24:17,736
Near a forest!

491
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:19,605
Would you rather be
at the motel?

492
00:24:19,607 --> 00:24:20,940
And a pool!

493
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,076
What exactly is Mom's new job?

494
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:26,712
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

495
00:24:26,714 --> 00:24:29,083
I like Mom's new job!

496
00:24:30,151 --> 00:24:32,086
Oh, ho, ho!

497
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:38,023
Whoa.

498
00:24:38,025 --> 00:24:39,126
Whoa.

499
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,529
Well, check out
the water features.

500
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,034
- Oh!
- Wow.

501
00:24:49,103 --> 00:24:51,136
Wicked cool!

502
00:24:56,711 --> 00:24:58,177
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

503
00:24:58,179 --> 00:24:59,979
- Not the couch! Stop it!
- No! Dash!

504
00:24:59,981 --> 00:25:01,580
Stop!

505
00:25:01,582 --> 00:25:02,748
- Don't touch the buttons!
- The couch!

506
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,916
- Dash!
- No!

507
00:25:03,918 --> 00:25:05,851
No, no!

508
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:07,753
Oh, no. Oh, boy.

509
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,890
This isn't me.

510
00:25:12,026 --> 00:25:15,594
I'm not all dark and angsty.

511
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:16,729
I'm Elastigirl.

512
00:25:16,731 --> 00:25:18,731
I'm, you know, flexible.

513
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,965
E designed this?

514
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:22,935
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

515
00:25:22,937 --> 00:25:25,070
Glad it's you and not me,

516
00:25:25,072 --> 00:25:27,806
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

517
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:29,208
This note came with it.

518
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,211
What?

519
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:39,151
A new Elasticycle.

520
00:25:39,153 --> 00:25:42,087
Elasticycle? I didn't
know you had a bike.

521
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:42,988
Hey, I had a mohawk.

522
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,823
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

523
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:46,859
Yeah, but... A mohawk?

524
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,194
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

525
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:53,999
Oh, yeah! This one's electric.

526
00:25:54,001 --> 00:25:57,104
- What's that mean?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

527
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,808
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

528
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,076
You will be great.

529
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,911
I will be great.
And you will, too.

530
00:26:05,913 --> 00:26:07,713
We will both be great.

531
00:26:07,715 --> 00:26:08,949
Bye, sweetie.

532
00:26:31,772 --> 00:26:33,138
Wait a minute!

533
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,673
- Is that Elastigirl?
- I think that's Elastigirl.

534
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,844
Hey! Elastigirl!

535
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,985
Marry me, Elastigirl!

536
00:26:47,088 --> 00:26:48,420
<i>♪ Here comes Elastigirl ♪</i>

537
00:26:48,422 --> 00:26:49,822
<i>♪ Stretching her ♪</i>

538
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:51,090
No theme songs

539
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:53,227
or I'll turn this bus
right around!

540
00:26:56,664 --> 00:26:58,230
Look at that.

541
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,231
New Urbem.

542
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:01,366
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement...

543
00:27:01,368 --> 00:27:03,102
you go where the crime is big.

544
00:27:03,104 --> 00:27:05,704
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

545
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:07,975
It's like
a superhero's playground!

546
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:14,246
No Sugar Bombs on my watch.

547
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:18,350
Where's Mom?

548
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,685
She's up and out.

549
00:27:19,687 --> 00:27:21,120
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

550
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:23,922
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

551
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,357
They are, for now.

552
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,727
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

553
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:29,962
She's not breaking...

554
00:27:29,964 --> 00:27:32,331
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

555
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,465
It's a new job.

556
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:36,268
So, Mom is going out
illegally...

557
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,738
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

558
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,440
Hey... Hey!

559
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,142
The bus is here!

560
00:27:43,144 --> 00:27:47,813
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the...

561
00:27:47,815 --> 00:27:50,050
Put your homework in your pack!

562
00:27:51,051 --> 00:27:52,153
Bye-bye!

563
00:27:58,025 --> 00:28:00,425
We're gonna get along
just fine...

564
00:28:00,427 --> 00:28:04,029
'cause you don't ask any hard questions.

565
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,133
<i>All right. All locations,</i>

566
00:28:08,135 --> 00:28:09,401
<i>we need to know
where you want us.</i>

567
00:28:09,403 --> 00:28:10,769
<i>Stand by.</i>

568
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,472
Seems strange to wait for crime.

569
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:15,307
Relax.
You're smack in the middle...

570
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:18,944
of the worst crime area
in the city. It's perfect.

571
00:28:18,946 --> 00:28:20,345
It's a superhero's playground.

572
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:22,047
<i>"It's a superhero's
playground." Right.</i>

573
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:23,749
You know,
after we went underground...

574
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:25,784
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner...

575
00:28:25,786 --> 00:28:27,386
waiting for something to happen.

576
00:28:27,388 --> 00:28:29,321
And I got mad at him for it.

577
00:28:31,025 --> 00:28:32,457
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

578
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:34,126
- <i>All units.</i>
- Something's up.

579
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,662
<i>We've been picking up
some chatter about</i>

580
00:28:35,664 --> 00:28:38,864
<i>potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony.</i>

581
00:28:38,866 --> 00:28:41,166
<i>- Disruption or threat?
- Both.</i>

582
00:28:41,168 --> 00:28:42,801
<i>Station's at Fifty-Fourth
and Nottingham.</i>

583
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:44,903
A potential threat! Perfect!

584
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:47,241
Fifty-fourth and Nottingham.
Go, go, go!

585
00:28:48,943 --> 00:28:52,344
Hey, Vi! I want you
back here by 10:30.

586
00:28:52,346 --> 00:28:53,412
11-ish?

587
00:28:53,414 --> 00:28:55,814
10-ish, heading for 9:30-ish.

588
00:28:55,816 --> 00:28:57,883
10:30-ish it is.

589
00:28:57,885 --> 00:28:59,418
Enjoy the movie.

590
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,521
"In the county of Noddoff..."

591
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,455
"the Frubbers of Freep..."

592
00:29:03,457 --> 00:29:08,829
"are all giving in to
the sweet succor of sleep."

593
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,839
<i>We will
control the horizontal...</i>

594
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:23,010
<i>we will control the vertical.</i>

595
00:29:28,816 --> 00:29:32,117
That's not the way you're
supposed to do it, Dad.

596
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:33,986
They want us to do it this way.

597
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:36,989
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

598
00:29:36,991 --> 00:29:39,224
- It's okay, Dad.
- Math is math!

599
00:29:39,226 --> 00:29:41,326
I'll just wait for Mom
to get back.

600
00:29:41,328 --> 00:29:42,327
What?

601
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,197
She won't understand it
any better than I do...

602
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:46,867
<i>The Outer Limits.</i>

603
00:29:49,837 --> 00:29:51,236
"All over Doozle-Dorf,"

604
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:53,872
"the Fribbers of Frupp
are going to sleep..."

605
00:29:53,874 --> 00:29:56,041
"'cause they just can't keep up."

606
00:29:56,043 --> 00:29:59,878
"All over Doozle-Dorf,
Doozles are dozing."

607
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,283
"Eyelids so heavy,
they're drooping."

608
00:30:05,452 --> 00:30:07,286
"Closing! The point is:"

609
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:10,022
"Everyone,
everyone's hitting the sack!"

610
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,258
"Everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack."

611
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,461
<i>Mayors often brag
about their cities...</i>

612
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:18,263
<i>and I'm no exception.</i>

613
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,532
<i>And I'm willing to admit</i>

614
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:21,900
<i>that New Urbem
is not the only city...</i>

615
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:24,169
Are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this?

616
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,171
<i>Sure. You're making
life easy for them.</i>

617
00:30:26,173 --> 00:30:27,573
They still haven't forgiven us

618
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,408
for the last time we made
life easy for them.

619
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,443
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

620
00:30:31,445 --> 00:30:32,344
With all due respect...

621
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:34,980
if you alone had handled
the Underminer...

622
00:30:34,982 --> 00:30:36,982
things would have
been different.

623
00:30:36,984 --> 00:30:38,350
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

624
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,452
<i>...on budget
and ahead of schedule...</i>

625
00:30:40,454 --> 00:30:44,089
<i>to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain.</i>

626
00:30:44,091 --> 00:30:46,592
<i>It can get you
where you need to go</i>

627
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,561
<i>at ridiculous speeds.</i>

628
00:30:48,563 --> 00:30:52,197
<i>The future is open for business!</i>

629
00:31:12,152 --> 00:31:13,619
Wait. The train has stopped.

630
00:31:17,157 --> 00:31:18,392
It's going the wrong direction.

631
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,494
It's going the wrong way.

632
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:22,497
I'm going after it.

633
00:31:27,368 --> 00:31:30,001
This thing's really moving.

634
00:31:30,003 --> 00:31:32,339
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

635
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,109
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

636
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:44,650
No one can shut this thing down?

637
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,019
<i>They've tried. No-go.</i>

638
00:31:48,021 --> 00:31:49,390
Is that Elastigirl?

639
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:58,230
Overrides?

640
00:31:58,232 --> 00:31:59,333
They're locked out
of the system.

641
00:32:06,306 --> 00:32:08,674
- What about a fail-safe?
- <i>Not enough time.</i>

642
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:13,546
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

643
00:32:13,548 --> 00:32:15,447
<i>Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high-tops</i>

644
00:32:15,449 --> 00:32:17,115
<i>and Dad can't find them either.</i>

645
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:19,317
<i>But he won't call you
and ask, so I am.</i>

646
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,986
<i>Do not call your mother!</i>

647
00:32:20,988 --> 00:32:22,387
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

648
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:24,289
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

649
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,258
<i>Less than two minutes!</i>

650
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,295
<i>There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.</i>

651
00:32:36,403 --> 00:32:38,640
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

652
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,834
What the heck was that?

653
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,136
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

654
00:34:51,138 --> 00:34:52,406
Are you all right?

655
00:34:55,677 --> 00:34:57,444
Your story better be good.

656
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:01,279
Hey. Hey!

657
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,782
What happened?

658
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:37,483
Honey, why are you...

659
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:40,320
Don't say anything.

660
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:46,759
It's Dad.
Are you okay?

661
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:49,962
I'm fine. I don't
wanna talk about it.

662
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:51,631
Tony didn't even call?

663
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:53,666
I don't wanna talk about it.

664
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:55,400
- Oh, honey...
- Dad!

665
00:35:55,402 --> 00:35:59,270
If you want me to feel
better, then leave me alone.

666
00:35:59,272 --> 00:36:00,372
Please?

667
00:36:00,374 --> 00:36:01,574
<i>See, there's nothing</i>

668
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,908
<i>a cop hates worse
than a missing child.</i>

669
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,511
<i>My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.</i>

670
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:06,879
<i>Oh, but if anybody</i>

671
00:36:06,881 --> 00:36:09,214
<i>can find that child,
it's you, Roman.</i>

672
00:36:09,216 --> 00:36:11,751
<i>Because you're
a wonderful policeman.</i>

673
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,553
<i>This is a holdup.</i>

674
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,656
<i>All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.</i>

675
00:36:16,658 --> 00:36:17,923
<i>Put your hands behind</i>

676
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,424
<i>your heads and keep them there!</i>

677
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,826
<i>Don't move!</i>

678
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:23,929
<i>Drop that.
All right, now get over there.</i>

679
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,398
<i>Watch the door.</i>

680
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,669
<i>You think I'm kiddin'?</i>

681
00:36:31,304 --> 00:36:32,437
<i>Now.</i>

682
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,543
<i>I said now!</i>

683
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:40,278
<i>I got it! Come on,
I tell you, come on!</i>

684
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,551
<i>You wanna get killed?</i>

685
00:37:39,439 --> 00:37:40,808
Uh-oh.

686
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:20,946
No, no, no!

687
00:38:23,651 --> 00:38:25,820
No!

688
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,722
No, no, no.

689
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,557
No, no, no.

690
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,761
No, no, no!

691
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,004
You have powers!

692
00:38:45,006 --> 00:38:46,605
Yeah, baby,

693
00:38:46,607 --> 00:38:48,674
and there's not
a scratch on you!

694
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,408
Did you go through
the locked door?

695
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:52,678
Are those your powers?

696
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,780
Who can multiply like rabbits

697
00:38:54,782 --> 00:38:57,750
and go right through
any solid...

698
00:39:01,722 --> 00:39:04,492
Oh, my God!

699
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,963
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>

700
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:12,832
- You weren't gonna call me?
- <i>Oh, hey!</i>

701
00:39:12,834 --> 00:39:14,967
No. I mean, yes, yeah...

702
00:39:14,969 --> 00:39:17,402
I just didn't wanna wake you.

703
00:39:17,404 --> 00:39:20,471
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

704
00:39:20,473 --> 00:39:21,607
Sounds like I just woke you up.

705
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,108
<i>No, no.</i>

706
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,810
- It's just, Jack-Jack...
- <i>He had an accident!</i>

707
00:39:24,812 --> 00:39:25,878
I knew it!

708
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,813
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have...

709
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:30,149
No accident. Stay there
and finish your mission.

710
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,684
You never should...

711
00:39:31,686 --> 00:39:33,752
What? You don't think
I can do this?

712
00:39:33,754 --> 00:39:36,454
No, no.
Sorry. I misspoke.

713
00:39:36,456 --> 00:39:37,857
Do you need me to come back?

714
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,726
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

715
00:39:40,728 --> 00:39:42,462
What happened with Jack-Jack?

716
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,865
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

717
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:47,967
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

718
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,636
- <i>How was Violet's date?</i>
- Uh...

719
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:52,437
<i>That was tonight, right?</i>

720
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:55,007
Yes. Good.

721
00:39:55,009 --> 00:39:57,009
All fine and good.

722
00:39:57,011 --> 00:39:58,978
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

723
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,746
Fine, yes, no trouble.

724
00:40:00,748 --> 00:40:02,615
And Dash got his homework done?

725
00:40:02,617 --> 00:40:03,883
All done.

726
00:40:03,885 --> 00:40:05,150
So, things haven't spiraled out

727
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,151
of control the moment I left?

728
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,020
Amazing as it may seem,

729
00:40:08,022 --> 00:40:10,689
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

730
00:40:10,691 --> 00:40:12,124
<i>How about you?</i>

731
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:15,029
I saved a runaway train!

732
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:18,130
<i>It was so great!</i>

733
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:20,900
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

734
00:40:20,902 --> 00:40:22,701
<i>Elastigirl pursued the train</i>

735
00:40:22,703 --> 00:40:24,870
<i>and was able
to successfully activate...</i>

736
00:40:24,872 --> 00:40:27,172
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon...

737
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,507
and the train starts pulling

738
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,042
out of the station backwards...

739
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,744
<i>...track of
its brand new hovertrain...</i>

740
00:40:31,746 --> 00:40:33,512
<i>...malfunctioned...</i>

741
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:34,715
<i>...thanking Elastigirl...</i>

742
00:40:35,917 --> 00:40:37,182
<i>Superhero Elastigirl...</i>

743
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,517
<i>Elastigirl...</i>

744
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,787
Boom! No casualties!

745
00:40:41,789 --> 00:40:43,055
<i>...specialized motorbike,</i>

746
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:44,657
<i>saving all of the passengers...</i>

747
00:40:44,659 --> 00:40:45,758
<i>One thing leads to another</i>

748
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,926
<i>and suddenly, I go after it!</i>

749
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:49,228
<i>I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!</i>

750
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:51,196
That's fantastic, honey!

751
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,599
And on your first night!

752
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:56,635
I am so proud of you, really.

753
00:40:56,637 --> 00:40:58,170
<i>I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

754
00:40:58,172 --> 00:41:00,839
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

755
00:41:00,841 --> 00:41:02,808
And you'll be amazing.

756
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,043
I couldn't have done this

757
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,678
if you hadn't
taken over so well.

758
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,513
<i>Thanks for handling everything.</i>

759
00:41:07,515 --> 00:41:08,914
It's nothing.

760
00:41:08,916 --> 00:41:12,017
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

761
00:41:12,019 --> 00:41:14,989
- <i>Sweet dreams.</i>
- Sweet dreams, honey.

762
00:41:31,138 --> 00:41:34,039
"Hey, Dad, it's okay."

763
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:36,842
"I'll just wait for Mom
to get home."

764
00:41:36,844 --> 00:41:39,814
As if she could...
I know how to...

765
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,983
I can do math.

766
00:41:51,826 --> 00:41:54,195
Oh, brother...

767
00:41:56,831 --> 00:41:58,733
Wait for Mom!

768
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,203
What am I, a substitute parent?

769
00:42:04,972 --> 00:42:07,008
It's not my fault
they changed math.

770
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:17,983
Come on, buddy. Come on.

771
00:42:17,985 --> 00:42:20,786
I think I understand
your math assignment.

772
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,623
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

773
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:26,592
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

774
00:42:26,594 --> 00:42:28,360
by themselves on one side.

775
00:42:28,362 --> 00:42:30,195
...you change the sign.

776
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:33,232
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus...

777
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:34,733
You got it?

778
00:42:34,735 --> 00:42:36,137
Yeah, baby!

779
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,718
Oh. Uh, hello.

780
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,053
We're in a new house.

781
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:57,322
I did write my address
on your locker...

782
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,358
in permanent ink.

783
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,660
Oh, is that what that is?

784
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,162
Did you forget?

785
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:05,199
Forget what?

786
00:43:05,966 --> 00:43:08,169
That's funny.

787
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:12,807
Points for funny.

788
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:16,075
Oh, was it the weird outfit?

789
00:43:16,077 --> 00:43:18,677
Because there's a reason.

790
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,813
I'm in a drama class...

791
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:23,015
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare...

792
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,983
but they're like, "Try to make
it relevant for the kids."

793
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:27,252
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

794
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:28,687
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,655
You wanna wear
one kind of tights...

796
00:43:29,657 --> 00:43:30,923
and then they're like,

797
00:43:30,925 --> 00:43:32,224
"No, wear these
other kind of tights."

798
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:33,260
Do I know you?

799
00:43:42,103 --> 00:43:44,269
<i>Many say your speech
today is critical.</i>

800
00:43:44,271 --> 00:43:47,039
<i>Both sides just want the
best for their people.</i>

801
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,909
<i>We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.</i>

802
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,811
I haven't done this in a while.

803
00:43:52,813 --> 00:43:55,114
This is good. The train
gives us momentum.

804
00:43:55,116 --> 00:43:57,349
Just go out there and
be your charming self...

805
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:58,817
and capitalize on it.

806
00:43:58,819 --> 00:44:01,286
Ms. Elastigirl,
they're ready for you.

807
00:44:01,288 --> 00:44:03,057
Hey, stretch a leg.

808
00:44:04,992 --> 00:44:06,725
Thank you, Chad. It was fun.

809
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,996
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

810
00:44:09,997 --> 00:44:11,997
Oh, Madame Ambassador, hello!

811
00:44:11,999 --> 00:44:13,365
Oh, you are Elastigirl!

812
00:44:13,367 --> 00:44:15,868
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

813
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:18,003
It was so sad
when you went underground.

814
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:22,007
I am glad to see you back
in your shiny outfit.

815
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:23,408
That means so much
coming from you.

816
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,743
Good luck with your speech.

817
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,111
This way, Ambassador.

818
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:27,446
Bring lasting peace!

819
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:29,348
I will, when you defeat evil.

820
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:31,450
Okay.

821
00:44:31,452 --> 00:44:33,220
Three, two...

822
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:35,287
For over 15 years,

823
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:36,889
superheroes have been in hiding.

824
00:44:36,891 --> 00:44:38,891
Forced into it by a society

825
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,425
no longer willing
to support them.

826
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,060
That may soon be changing...

827
00:44:42,062 --> 00:44:44,497
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

828
00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:46,331
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

829
00:44:46,333 --> 00:44:48,267
heroic save
of a runaway train...

830
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:51,803
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

831
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:53,138
- Welcome!
- Hello, Chad.

832
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,307
All the polls are going
in your direction.

833
00:44:55,309 --> 00:44:57,042
That's true. Things are good...

834
00:44:57,044 --> 00:44:58,443
Hello.

835
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,145
Uh, hello?

836
00:45:00,147 --> 00:45:02,347
Do I have your attention?

837
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:03,782
Yes, Chad.

838
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,050
Of course I do.

839
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,919
I'm appearing on your screen.

840
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:09,988
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

841
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:11,890
Screens are everywhere.

842
00:45:11,892 --> 00:45:13,025
We are controlled by screens.

843
00:45:14,828 --> 00:45:19,798
<i>And screens
are controlled by me...</i>

844
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,366
<i>Screenslaver.</i>

845
00:45:21,368 --> 00:45:22,801
Hey!

846
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,937
<i>I control this broadcast...</i>

847
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:27,339
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

848
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:29,074
What's wrong with him?

849
00:45:29,076 --> 00:45:30,075
The signal's been hijacked.
I'll check it out.

850
00:45:30,077 --> 00:45:31,843
Don't look at any monitors.

851
00:45:31,845 --> 00:45:34,112
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade...

852
00:45:34,114 --> 00:45:36,415
while it's still airborne.

853
00:45:36,417 --> 00:45:38,219
Right, Elastigirl?

854
00:45:40,321 --> 00:45:42,923
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

855
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:57,102
- Oh, what's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

856
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:58,839
Which one?

857
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:09,248
Elastigirl!
What are you doing here?

858
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:11,584
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she...

859
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:13,120
Look out!

860
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:16,957
Follow them and get me close!

861
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,263
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

862
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:34,840
Stand down! It's Elastigirl.

863
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:36,443
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

864
00:46:43,117 --> 00:46:45,250
We're under attack!

865
00:46:45,252 --> 00:46:48,222
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

866
00:46:51,593 --> 00:46:52,891
Open the door!

867
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,094
Do as she says!

868
00:46:56,130 --> 00:46:57,229
Can you all swim?

869
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,899
- Yeah.
- No!

870
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:23,188
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

871
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:32,532
Are you all right, ma'am?

872
00:47:32,534 --> 00:47:34,335
I'm perfectly fine...

873
00:47:36,571 --> 00:47:38,138
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

874
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:46,945
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

875
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,246
Good morning!

876
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:50,148
He takes one look
at me in that suit...

877
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:54,052
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

878
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:56,154
He's protecting himself.

879
00:47:56,156 --> 00:47:59,024
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

880
00:47:59,026 --> 00:48:00,959
It's better for you, too.

881
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,061
I can't tell you
how many memories

882
00:48:03,063 --> 00:48:05,364
Dicker's had to erase
over the years...

883
00:48:05,366 --> 00:48:07,165
when someone figured out

884
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,967
your mother's or my identity.

885
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,303
It was Dicker!

886
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:13,539
- You told him about Tony!
- Honey...

887
00:48:13,541 --> 00:48:16,477
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

888
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,691
I hate superheroes!

889
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:33,994
And I renounce them!

890
00:48:40,033 --> 00:48:41,967
I renounce them!

891
00:48:50,612 --> 00:48:52,512
Is she having adolescence?

892
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:55,347
<i>A new report
out today shows that,</i>

893
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:57,182
<i>when it comes
to decision-making...</i>

894
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,017
<i>people have more trust
in a monkey</i>

895
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,385
<i>throwing darts than Congress.</i>

896
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:02,555
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

897
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,657
They're here in support.

898
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:06,992
Support? Support of what?

899
00:49:06,994 --> 00:49:09,562
Well, in support of you.

900
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,667
Wow. Oh, hey...

901
00:49:14,669 --> 00:49:17,302
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

902
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:20,071
Oh, my goodness. Thanks so much.

903
00:49:20,073 --> 00:49:21,206
Oh, hello.

904
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:22,577
What does your sign say?

905
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,614
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

906
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:31,216
Supers should be legal now!

907
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,519
Talk to ya. Oh, what do ya know!

908
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:34,620
Ellenwood.

909
00:49:34,622 --> 00:49:36,656
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

910
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:38,023
about superheroes, huh?

911
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:39,725
Oh. I'll have to call you back.

912
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,126
Oh, that felt good.

913
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:42,327
Felicia, hold my calls, please.

914
00:49:42,329 --> 00:49:44,129
Hey! It's working!

915
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,264
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

916
00:49:46,266 --> 00:49:47,466
about superheroes today.

917
00:49:47,468 --> 00:49:49,201
Turns out saving someone's life

918
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:50,603
makes a good impression
on them. Who knew, huh?

919
00:49:50,605 --> 00:49:53,104
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

920
00:49:53,106 --> 00:49:55,508
Media awareness is up 72%.

921
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,610
The push
for superhero legalization

922
00:49:57,612 --> 00:49:59,612
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

923
00:49:59,614 --> 00:50:01,514
I have big plans
for our next move.

924
00:50:01,516 --> 00:50:03,348
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

925
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,449
We'll use our ship...

926
00:50:04,451 --> 00:50:06,686
we'll gather leaders
and Supers...

927
00:50:06,688 --> 00:50:09,421
- from all over the world.
- That's great.

928
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,556
I'm happy.

929
00:50:10,558 --> 00:50:12,224
I'm happy the numbers are up.

930
00:50:12,226 --> 00:50:15,327
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro-superhero...

931
00:50:15,329 --> 00:50:17,095
and I'm happy you're happy.

932
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,365
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

933
00:50:20,367 --> 00:50:22,100
Because I didn't get him!

934
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,503
Screenslaver is still out there.

935
00:50:23,505 --> 00:50:26,338
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

936
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,507
He's gonna want more

937
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:29,642
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

938
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:31,711
One thing
I've learned in business?

939
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:33,646
Smell the flowers.

940
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:35,180
They don't bloom that often.

941
00:50:35,182 --> 00:50:36,649
What do you want
on your tombstone?

942
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:37,783
"She worried a lot"?

943
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:39,785
All right, stop talking.

944
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:41,188
Show her.

945
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,261
This is just so exciting, isn't it?
Huh?

946
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:53,198
Oh, wow. Uh...

947
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,401
Wow! Elastigirl, there you are.

948
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:57,837
- Hello.
- I didn't...

949
00:50:57,839 --> 00:50:59,304
Wow!

950
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,641
Come on, get yourself
together, Karen.

951
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:04,744
Hi, my superhero name is Voyd.

952
00:51:04,746 --> 00:51:08,748
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

953
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:14,288
Okay, what I can do,
um, is this.

954
00:51:19,393 --> 00:51:21,459
Yeah.

955
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:25,230
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

956
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:27,432
I felt like an outcast before.

957
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:32,170
But now, with you being
you, I feel like...

958
00:51:33,575 --> 00:51:34,576
Yay, me.

959
00:51:35,643 --> 00:51:37,610
I flew them in from all over.

960
00:51:37,612 --> 00:51:39,477
They've all been in hiding.

961
00:51:39,479 --> 00:51:41,681
They have powers,
secret identities...

962
00:51:41,683 --> 00:51:44,550
and names
they've given themselves.

963
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:46,852
I'm Screech. It's a pleasure.

964
00:51:46,854 --> 00:51:48,253
I've always considered you

965
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:50,322
the gold standard
for superheroes.

966
00:51:50,324 --> 00:51:52,457
Well, thanks. You're too nice.

967
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:54,359
I am called Brick.

968
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:57,730
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

969
00:51:57,732 --> 00:51:59,297
Wisconsin.

970
00:51:59,299 --> 00:52:02,434
Oh. Elastigirl.
I assume your powers are...

971
00:52:02,436 --> 00:52:04,704
You know,
zapping things electrically...

972
00:52:04,706 --> 00:52:07,238
charging things, bolts of
lightning, that kind of stuff.

973
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,708
Name's Reflux.

974
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:11,677
Medical condition or
superpower, you decide.

975
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:13,311
That's a little line

976
00:52:13,313 --> 00:52:14,747
I say just to put
people at ease.

977
00:52:14,749 --> 00:52:15,881
Hope I don't offend.

978
00:52:15,883 --> 00:52:17,917
Oh, no, no, no. Reflux. Love it.

979
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:22,253
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

980
00:52:22,255 --> 00:52:25,323
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

981
00:52:26,694 --> 00:52:28,226
Ow!

982
00:52:31,264 --> 00:52:34,634
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations.
Big day.

983
00:52:34,636 --> 00:52:37,202
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

984
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:38,504
Good night.

985
00:52:38,506 --> 00:52:40,205
Must be nice for you,

986
00:52:40,207 --> 00:52:41,774
being out front
after all this time.

987
00:52:41,776 --> 00:52:43,341
Out front?

988
00:52:43,343 --> 00:52:45,911
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days...

989
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,747
and even then, you were kind of

990
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:49,347
in Mr. Incredible's shadow.

991
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:50,783
Nah, I beg to differ.

992
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:52,785
I'm not... I'm not
saying you weren't big.

993
00:52:52,787 --> 00:52:54,787
No, you were,
and are, a superstar...

994
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:57,723
but you have the stage
to yourself now.

995
00:52:57,725 --> 00:52:59,759
And people have
to pay attention.

996
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:01,560
Oh, you mean, "It's a man's
world" and all that?

997
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:03,428
Well, what world do you live in?

998
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,764
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

999
00:53:04,766 --> 00:53:08,901
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

1000
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:12,470
I ask you, which of us
has the greater influence?

1001
00:53:12,472 --> 00:53:13,939
Which side of me are you asking?

1002
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:15,407
The believer or the cynic?

1003
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:16,676
The cynic...

1004
00:53:16,678 --> 00:53:18,410
Would say selling
is more important

1005
00:53:18,412 --> 00:53:20,445
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

1006
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:22,247
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

1007
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:23,983
It only matters what people buy.

1008
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:25,685
This is true.

1009
00:53:25,687 --> 00:53:27,653
If I discovered the
origin of the universe...

1010
00:53:27,655 --> 00:53:29,287
my brother would find a way

1011
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,257
to market it as a,
uh, foot massager.

1012
00:53:34,595 --> 00:53:36,495
So, what would the believer say?

1013
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:38,831
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

1014
00:53:38,833 --> 00:53:41,299
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

1015
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,802
and impose your will
on the status quo.

1016
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:44,670
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

1017
00:53:44,672 --> 00:53:45,971
You sound like my brother.

1018
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,372
Well, he's not wrong.

1019
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:48,708
There is an art
to getting a reaction...

1020
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:50,442
Oh! I know how to get him.

1021
00:53:50,444 --> 00:53:53,478
- My brother?
- No. Screenslaver!

1022
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,281
You're tech-savvy. I need
to lock onto a signal...

1023
00:53:56,283 --> 00:53:57,449
and trace its origin.

1024
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:58,584
How fast can you
slap something together

1025
00:53:58,586 --> 00:53:59,785
and meet me at the airport?

1026
00:53:59,787 --> 00:54:00,786
Airport?

1027
00:54:00,788 --> 00:54:02,555
Need to go out of town, pronto.

1028
00:54:02,557 --> 00:54:03,723
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 a.m.

1029
00:54:03,725 --> 00:54:05,825
I need to get on TV. Chad!

1030
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:07,593
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

1031
00:54:07,595 --> 00:54:08,761
tonight on the newscast.

1032
00:54:08,763 --> 00:54:09,962
Finish our interview by phone!

1033
00:54:09,964 --> 00:54:11,329
Promote the hell out of it.

1034
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,732
Independence from Screenslavery!

1035
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:15,568
- Chad tonight.
- Boom!

1036
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,405
- Dicker.
- <i>Yeah, hey, Rick.</i>

1037
00:54:20,407 --> 00:54:22,007
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

1038
00:54:22,009 --> 00:54:23,308
Tony Rydinger.

1039
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:25,010
Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

1040
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,712
Well, you also wiped out

1041
00:54:26,714 --> 00:54:28,714
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

1042
00:54:28,716 --> 00:54:31,349
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

1043
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,619
Oops. Not an exact science, Bob.

1044
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:35,488
<i>Rick, you gotta help me here.</i>

1045
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:38,524
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

1046
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:41,026
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

1047
00:54:41,028 --> 00:54:42,427
Um...

1048
00:54:42,429 --> 00:54:43,896
Not much.

1049
00:54:43,898 --> 00:54:45,498
Seems like a good kid.

1050
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,666
Popular, plays sports, music.

1051
00:54:47,668 --> 00:54:51,504
Parents own The Happy Platter,
kid works there part time.

1052
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:53,674
Happy Platter?

1053
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,911
Why did we drive
all the way across town

1054
00:54:58,913 --> 00:55:00,713
for The Happy Platter?

1055
00:55:00,715 --> 00:55:04,349
We'd like a booth over there,
near the philodendron.

1056
00:55:04,351 --> 00:55:06,485
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

1057
00:55:08,756 --> 00:55:11,924
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

1058
00:55:11,926 --> 00:55:13,893
It looks bored.

1059
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,795
Ha-ha! The Bored Platter!

1060
00:55:15,797 --> 00:55:18,363
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

1061
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:19,532
from drive-in food.

1062
00:55:19,534 --> 00:55:21,432
I like drive-in food.

1063
00:55:21,434 --> 00:55:23,401
Does this mean vegetables?

1064
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,403
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

1065
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,506
Get used to it.

1066
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:29,542
Good evening, everyone.

1067
00:55:29,544 --> 00:55:31,143
Oh, no!

1068
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:32,745
- Is she all right?
- Violet, are you okay?

1069
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:33,946
Nothing to see here.

1070
00:55:33,948 --> 00:55:35,714
Yeah, more napkins
would be good.

1071
00:55:35,716 --> 00:55:36,849
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It happens all the time here.

1072
00:55:36,851 --> 00:55:37,750
Mops it right up.

1073
00:55:37,752 --> 00:55:40,653
Normally, she doesn't
ever drip like this.

1074
00:55:40,655 --> 00:55:42,822
- Would you like water, sir?
- Yes.

1075
00:55:42,824 --> 00:55:45,791
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter...

1076
00:55:45,793 --> 00:55:47,493
- who you must know, right?
- God. Stop.

1077
00:55:47,495 --> 00:55:48,828
- Hello.
- Violet.

1078
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:49,995
Hello, Violet.

1079
00:55:51,132 --> 00:55:52,598
Hey, Vi, say hi to...

1080
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,966
Don't push it, Dad.

1081
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:55,968
I'm Dash, her little brother.

1082
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:57,136
Hello.

1083
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:59,605
Mmm. This is really good water.

1084
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:00,906
It's very refreshing.

1085
00:56:00,908 --> 00:56:01,774
Spring water, is it?

1086
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,677
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

1087
00:56:04,679 --> 00:56:06,444
Well, it is very good.

1088
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,847
Excellent tap.

1089
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:09,982
Excuse me.

1090
00:56:09,984 --> 00:56:11,817
Well, nice to meet you.

1091
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,552
- Where'd she go?
- Mmm.

1092
00:56:13,554 --> 00:56:16,655
To find a good place
to be angry?

1093
00:56:16,657 --> 00:56:19,558
Tonight, we go now to
a special remote interview...

1094
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,759
with Elastigirl.

1095
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:21,794
<i>How you feeling, Chad?</i>

1096
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,062
<i>You doing all right?</i>

1097
00:56:23,064 --> 00:56:25,564
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

1098
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:27,566
I have no memory of the event.

1099
00:56:27,568 --> 00:56:29,467
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

1100
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,836
to see a recording...

1101
00:56:30,838 --> 00:56:33,505
<i>of yourself the night before
and have no recollection.</i>

1102
00:56:33,507 --> 00:56:35,074
<i>I don't think
anyone needs to worry.</i>

1103
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:37,543
<i>We've taken many precautions
tonight though.</i>

1104
00:56:37,545 --> 00:56:38,878
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

1105
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,914
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

1106
00:56:41,916 --> 00:56:43,616
<i>I wanna talk about you...</i>

1107
00:56:43,618 --> 00:56:46,018
<i>starting with your save
of a runaway train.</i>

1108
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:48,587
<i>Here's an exclusive
unedited clip</i>

1109
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,022
<i>from your own suit cam.</i>

1110
00:56:50,024 --> 00:56:51,123
<i>Roll the clip.</i>

1111
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:53,893
<i>This thing's really moving.</i>

1112
00:56:53,895 --> 00:56:56,629
<i>100 and climbing.
How much track is built?</i>

1113
00:56:56,631 --> 00:56:59,565
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

1114
00:56:59,567 --> 00:57:02,768
<i>The Screenslaver
interrupts this program...</i>

1115
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:04,203
<i>for an important announcement.</i>

1116
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:06,105
I'll be damned. She knew.

1117
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:07,873
Let's see if your gadget works.

1118
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:10,142
<i>Don't bother watching the rest.</i>

1119
00:57:10,144 --> 00:57:11,644
Gotcha!

1120
00:57:11,646 --> 00:57:13,879
<i>Elastigirl doesn't save the day.</i>

1121
00:57:13,881 --> 00:57:16,749
<i>She only postpones her defeat.</i>

1122
00:57:16,751 --> 00:57:18,951
<i>And while she postpones
her defeat...</i>

1123
00:57:18,953 --> 00:57:22,621
<i>you eat chips and watch
her confront problems...</i>

1124
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:24,890
<i>that you are too lazy
to deal with.</i>

1125
00:57:24,892 --> 00:57:27,793
<i>Superheroes are part
of your brainless desire...</i>

1126
00:57:27,795 --> 00:57:31,030
<i>to replace true experience
with simulation.</i>

1127
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:34,533
<i>You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.</i>

1128
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:38,103
<i>You don't play games,

<i>Travel, relationships, risk...</i>

1130

<i>every meaningful experience

1131

<i>and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.</i>

1132
00:57:47,682 --> 00:57:50,149
<i>So that you can remain
ever sheltered...</i>

1133
00:57:50,151 --> 00:57:51,850
<i>ever passive...</i>

1134
00:57:51,852 --> 00:57:54,253
<i>ever ravenous consumers...</i>

1135
00:57:54,255 --> 00:57:57,256
<i>who can't bring themselves

<i>break a sweat
and participate in life.</i>

1137
00:58:01,696 --> 00:58:04,263
<i>You want superheroes
to protect you...</i>

1138
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:08,567
<i>and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.</i>

1139
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:12,104
<i>While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.</i>

1140
00:58:12,106 --> 00:58:14,239
<i>That your interests
are being served.</i>

1141
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,109
<i>And your rights
are being upheld.</i>

1142
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:20,245
<i>So that the system can
keep stealing from you...</i>

1143
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:23,115
<i>smiling at you all the while.</i>

1144
00:58:23,117 --> 00:58:26,819
<i>Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.</i>

1145
00:58:26,821 --> 00:58:29,154
<i>Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,</i>

1146
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:31,256
<i>and see what happens.</i>

1147
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:34,293
<i>You are no longer in control.</i>

1148
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,896
<i>I am.</i>

1149
01:00:17,431 --> 01:00:19,166
Find anything?

1150
01:01:09,884 --> 01:01:11,185
Sorry!

1151
01:01:43,417 --> 01:01:44,917
What happened?

1152
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:47,986
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

1153
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:49,755
What's going on? What did I do?

1154
01:01:49,757 --> 01:01:51,223
What did you guys do to me?

1155
01:01:51,225 --> 01:01:54,993
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

1156
01:01:54,995 --> 01:01:56,895
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

1157
01:01:56,897 --> 01:01:58,163
<i>You're a genius.</i>

1158
01:01:58,165 --> 01:01:59,064
Aw, shucks!

1159
01:01:59,066 --> 01:02:01,867
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

1160
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:04,236
Hey, Dad.

1161
01:02:04,238 --> 01:02:08,240
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

1162
01:02:08,242 --> 01:02:09,308
and I don't get 'em.

1163
01:02:09,310 --> 01:02:10,442
Aren't you...

1164
01:02:10,444 --> 01:02:11,910
Didn't we get all caught up?

1165
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:13,345
Yeah, we were caught up...

1166
01:02:13,347 --> 01:02:16,815
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1167
01:02:16,817 --> 01:02:18,183
Decimals.

1168
01:02:18,185 --> 01:02:19,485
<i>...the
addition of the Incredibile,</i>

1169
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:20,886
<i>the super car...</i>

1170
01:02:20,888 --> 01:02:23,255
<i>once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.</i>

1171
01:02:23,257 --> 01:02:26,225
<i>It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.</i>

1172
01:02:26,227 --> 01:02:28,561
They said it was beyond repair.

1173
01:02:28,563 --> 01:02:30,095
<i>Hey,
it was in perfect condition.</i>

1174
01:02:30,097 --> 01:02:31,897
You used to drive that?

1175
01:02:31,899 --> 01:02:33,398
They said it was destroyed.

1176
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:35,267
<i>Long thought lost or destroyed,</i>

1177
01:02:35,269 --> 01:02:37,436
<i>the famous car
turned up at private auction.</i>

1178
01:02:37,438 --> 01:02:38,937
They said it was...

1179
01:02:38,939 --> 01:02:40,939
That's my car!

1180
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:51,316
Stupid water feature!

1181
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:54,086
<i>This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.</i>

1182
01:02:54,088 --> 01:02:55,254
<i>Care to demonstrate?</i>

1183
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:57,422
<i>I'd love to,
but we haven't figured out</i>

1184
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:58,991
<i>how to make them work yet.</i>

1185
01:03:00,928 --> 01:03:04,064
Wow! It works?

1186
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:06,532
Huh?

1187
01:03:06,534 --> 01:03:09,001
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

1188
01:03:09,003 --> 01:03:10,269
That's a rocket launcher!

1189
01:03:10,271 --> 01:03:12,271
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

1190
01:03:12,273 --> 01:03:14,006
Hey! This is not your car!

1191
01:03:14,008 --> 01:03:15,340
It's not your car, either!

1192
01:03:15,342 --> 01:03:17,142
It is so! It's the Incredibile.

1193
01:03:17,144 --> 01:03:19,177
- Why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't!

1194
01:03:19,179 --> 01:03:20,946
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1195
01:03:20,948 --> 01:03:22,414
Launch the rockets!

1196
01:03:22,416 --> 01:03:23,949
- I'm not launching anything!
- I wanna blow it up!

1197
01:03:23,951 --> 01:03:25,017
Do you think I want
an angry rich guy...

1198
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:26,519
coming after me right now...

1199
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:28,253
- when I'm trying not to...
- <i>I'm not sure</i>

1200
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,321
- <i>what's happened here, Mark.</i>
- ...distract your mother.

1201
01:03:29,323 --> 01:03:31,023
<i>But everyone here has scattered</i>

1202
01:03:31,025 --> 01:03:32,924
<i>and I'm afraid I'll need
to move at any minute.</i>

1203
01:03:32,926 --> 01:03:35,462
Rich guy got my car.

1204
01:03:37,331 --> 01:03:40,098
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

1205
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:41,503
back from the rich guy?

1206
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:52,277
What the heck is that?

1207
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:58,050
Jack-Jack has powers?

1208
01:03:58,052 --> 01:03:59,184
Well, yeah, but...

1209
01:03:59,186 --> 01:04:00,620
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

1210
01:04:00,622 --> 01:04:02,454
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I don't know.

1211
01:04:02,456 --> 01:04:04,990
We're your kids. We need
to know these things.

1212
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:06,291
- Did you tell Mom?
- No.

1213
01:04:06,293 --> 01:04:08,193
- Why not?
- Your mother is not...

1214
01:04:08,195 --> 01:04:09,928
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you?

1215
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,263
- Why would you not tell Mom?
- Because I didn't wanna...

1216
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,464
What?

1217
01:04:12,466 --> 01:04:13,666
- Come on, man.
- Because it's not the time.

1218
01:04:13,668 --> 01:04:14,933
- Why?
- Because...

1219
01:04:14,935 --> 01:04:16,034
So uncool!

1220
01:04:16,036 --> 01:04:18,170
Because I'm formulating, okay?

1221
01:04:18,172 --> 01:04:21,073
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

1222
01:04:21,075 --> 01:04:23,141
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend...

1223
01:04:23,143 --> 01:04:24,376
and keeping the baby

1224
01:04:24,378 --> 01:04:25,611
from turning into
a flaming monster!

1225
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,047
How do I do it?

1226
01:04:28,015 --> 01:04:30,182
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

1227
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:32,918
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

1228
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,487
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1229
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:38,023
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre-Guy.

1230
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:40,593
Mr. Incredible!

1231
01:04:42,229 --> 01:04:44,463
We should call Lucius.

1232
01:04:44,465 --> 01:04:46,131
No. I can handle it.

1233
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:48,467
There's no way I'm gonna...

1234
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,313
Dada.

1235
01:05:00,114 --> 01:05:02,247
I'm calling Lucius.

1236
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,253
Looks normal to me. When
did this start happening?

1237
01:05:08,255 --> 01:05:10,288
Since Helen got the job.

1238
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,224
- I assume she knows?
- Are you kidding?

1239
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:13,526
I can't tell her about this,

1240
01:05:13,528 --> 01:05:15,060
not while she's doing hero work!

1241
01:05:15,062 --> 01:05:16,361
Mama!

1242
01:05:16,363 --> 01:05:17,730
<i>Girls, come on.</i>

1243
01:05:17,732 --> 01:05:19,264
<i>Leave the saving the world
to the men?</i>

1244
01:05:19,266 --> 01:05:20,633
- <i>I don't think so.</i>
- Mama!

1245
01:05:20,635 --> 01:05:22,502
I've got to succeed!

1246
01:05:22,504 --> 01:05:24,202
So she can succeed.

1247
01:05:24,204 --> 01:05:26,672
- So we can succeed!
- I get it, Bob!

1248
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:29,642
I get it. When was the
last time you slept?

1249
01:05:29,644 --> 01:05:31,476
Who keeps track of that?

1250
01:05:31,478 --> 01:05:33,044
Besides, he's a baby.

1251
01:05:33,046 --> 01:05:35,414
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

1252
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,349
So, you good then?

1253
01:05:37,351 --> 01:05:39,752
You got everything
under control? Right?

1254
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,022
What the...?

1255
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:47,192
Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie?

1256
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,128
Num-num cookie?
Cha Cha wanna num-num?

1257
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:52,998
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1258
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,166
- You're not...
- Cookie!

1259
01:05:54,168 --> 01:05:55,467
- Oh, my God!
- Cookie!

1260
01:05:55,469 --> 01:05:57,469
- Dada! Dada. Dada.
- Whoa.

1261
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,271
Okay! Okay.

1262
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:01,239
So, he can still
hear you from the...

1263
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:03,275
From the other dimension, yeah.

1264
01:06:03,277 --> 01:06:05,377
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like...

1265
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:08,413
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

1266
01:06:08,415 --> 01:06:11,116
Full powers, totally random.

1267
01:06:11,118 --> 01:06:13,452
So now, he's what? Is he good?

1268
01:06:13,454 --> 01:06:15,588
Yeah, you'd think so, right?

1269
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,691
Obviously, I can't keep
giving him cookies!

1270
01:06:18,693 --> 01:06:20,660
- Uh-uh?
- But if I stop...

1271
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:26,231
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

1272
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,733
No biting the daddy!

1273
01:06:27,735 --> 01:06:29,102
- What the...?
- No biting!

1274
01:06:34,676 --> 01:06:37,110
Okay.

1275
01:06:38,513 --> 01:06:41,614
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

1276
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,148
Then I'll be good to go.

1277
01:06:43,150 --> 01:06:45,317
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

1278
01:06:45,319 --> 01:06:47,219
You need major life realignment

1279
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:48,453
on a number of levels.

1280
01:06:48,455 --> 01:06:51,223
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

1281
01:06:51,225 --> 01:06:55,095
You need some solid
outside-the-box thinking.

1282
01:07:03,638 --> 01:07:05,237
<i>Galbaki?</i>

1283
01:07:05,239 --> 01:07:09,307
<i>Elastigirl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?</i>

1284
01:07:09,309 --> 01:07:10,776
<i>Explain yourself!</i>

1285
01:07:13,815 --> 01:07:16,582
<i>Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.</i>

1286
01:07:16,584 --> 01:07:19,685
<i>It's the baby.
I brought the baby.</i>

1287
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:23,525
<i>Oh, highly unusual.</i>

1288
01:07:30,865 --> 01:07:32,665
You look ghastly, Robert.

1289
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:34,834
I haven't been sleeping.

1290
01:07:34,836 --> 01:07:38,538
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math...

1291
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:41,607
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's...

1292
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:44,544
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

1293
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:46,846
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

1294
01:07:46,848 --> 01:07:49,147
and now everything's pink.

1295
01:07:49,149 --> 01:07:50,415
And I think we need eggs.

1296
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:54,185
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

1297
01:07:54,187 --> 01:07:55,688
Done properly.

1298
01:07:55,690 --> 01:07:58,858
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1299
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:00,560
But you do not come to me

1300
01:08:00,562 --> 01:08:03,194
for eggs and batteries, Robert.

1301
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:04,597
I design herowear

1302
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:07,265
and Elastigirl
must have a new suit.

1303
01:08:07,267 --> 01:08:09,869
Actually, it's Jack-Jack.

1304
01:08:09,871 --> 01:08:12,705
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

1305
01:08:12,707 --> 01:08:16,742
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

1306
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:19,512
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

1307
01:08:19,514 --> 01:08:21,614
If I could just leave him
with you for a while...

1308
01:08:21,616 --> 01:08:23,450
Leave him? Here?

1309
01:08:24,552 --> 01:08:26,686
I am not a baby person, Robert.

1310
01:08:26,688 --> 01:08:29,655
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

1311
01:08:29,657 --> 01:08:32,727
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day to...

1312
01:08:33,695 --> 01:08:35,195
day.

1313
01:08:38,332 --> 01:08:40,300
Fascinating!

1314
01:08:42,737 --> 01:08:44,606
Are you seeing this, Robert?

1315
01:08:46,473 --> 01:08:47,609
Dada.

1316
01:08:56,551 --> 01:08:59,487
Oh, my God.

1317
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,754
Yes!

1318
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:03,589
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

1319
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,323
I'm sure filling in
for Helen is challenging,

1320
01:09:05,325 --> 01:09:06,525
and you are very tired...

1321
01:09:06,527 --> 01:09:07,627
and the other children need you

1322
01:09:07,629 --> 01:09:09,327
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

1323
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:10,763
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything...

1324
01:09:10,765 --> 01:09:13,568
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1325
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:17,903
"Auntie Edna"?

1326
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:24,710
Attention. Attention.

1327
01:09:24,712 --> 01:09:27,379
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight...

1328
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:28,781
in support of superheroes...

1329
01:09:28,783 --> 01:09:32,384
and bringing them
back into society!

1330
01:09:32,386 --> 01:09:33,986
You all made it happen.

1331
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:35,420
The need for this has been made

1332
01:09:35,422 --> 01:09:36,789
crystal clear in recent days...

1333
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,724
with bad actors
like the self-proclaimed

1334
01:09:38,726 --> 01:09:40,893
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

1335
01:09:40,895 --> 01:09:42,495
His reign was short, huh?

1336
01:09:42,497 --> 01:09:44,597
And thanks to this woman...

1337
01:09:44,599 --> 01:09:47,767
a great super. You love her.
You missed her.

1338
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:51,671
Welcome back, Elastigirl.

1339
01:09:51,673 --> 01:09:54,472
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1340
01:09:54,474 --> 01:09:56,876
Come on. Get up here.

1341
01:09:56,878 --> 01:09:59,679
I want you to have this.

1342
01:09:59,681 --> 01:10:01,446
A memento.

1343
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,817
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1344
01:10:04,819 --> 01:10:06,819
I am forever in your debt.

1345
01:10:06,821 --> 01:10:08,554
And thanks to all of you,

1346
01:10:08,556 --> 01:10:11,657
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1347
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:13,959
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time...

1348
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:17,429
which leads me to an
important announcement.

1349
01:10:17,431 --> 01:10:19,632
Just now,
at a worldwide summit...

1350
01:10:19,634 --> 01:10:21,534
leaders from more than a hundred

1351
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:23,301
of the world's top countries...

1352
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,839
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1353
01:10:28,643 --> 01:10:30,442
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1354
01:10:30,444 --> 01:10:31,644
from all over the planet...

1355
01:10:31,646 --> 01:10:33,445
on our boat, the <i>Everjust...</i>

1356
01:10:33,447 --> 01:10:36,816
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

1357
01:10:36,818 --> 01:10:40,720
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1358
01:10:43,891 --> 01:10:46,291
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1359
01:10:46,293 --> 01:10:48,293
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

1360
01:10:48,295 --> 01:10:51,429
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1361
01:10:51,431 --> 01:10:53,999
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

1362
01:10:54,001 --> 01:10:55,801
with the life stuff?

1363
01:10:55,803 --> 01:10:58,003
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

1364
01:11:00,908 --> 01:11:02,340
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

1365
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:04,342
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

1366
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:07,046
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

1367
01:11:28,636 --> 01:11:30,938
- Hey, Vi.
- Hey.

1368
01:11:32,006 --> 01:11:33,471
Where's Jack-Jack?

1369
01:11:33,473 --> 01:11:34,673
E's taking him for a little bit.

1370
01:11:34,675 --> 01:11:37,442
- Edna is babysitting?
- Yeah.

1371
01:11:37,444 --> 01:11:39,512
And you're okay with this?

1372
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:41,949
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

1373
01:11:43,851 --> 01:11:46,554
I wanted to say
something to you.

1374
01:11:47,588 --> 01:11:49,989
Sorry about Tony.

1375
01:11:49,991 --> 01:11:52,958
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory...

1376
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,629
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice...

1377
01:11:56,631 --> 01:12:00,566
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

1378
01:12:00,568 --> 01:12:02,635
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

1379
01:12:02,637 --> 01:12:04,103
by trying to...

1380
01:12:04,105 --> 01:12:06,105
Anyway. Anyway...

1381
01:12:06,107 --> 01:12:07,973
I'm sorry.

1382
01:12:07,975 --> 01:12:09,542
I'm used to knowing

1383
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:11,442
what the right thing to do is...

1384
01:12:11,444 --> 01:12:14,613
but now, I'm not sure anymore.

1385
01:12:14,615 --> 01:12:16,717
I just wanna be...

1386
01:12:18,953 --> 01:12:20,488
a good dad.

1387
01:12:24,125 --> 01:12:26,494
You're not good.

1388
01:12:28,428 --> 01:12:29,897
You're super.

1389
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,608
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

1390
01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:45,744
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1391
01:12:45,746 --> 01:12:47,880
I know I should be up there...

1392
01:12:47,882 --> 01:12:50,082
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

1393
01:12:50,084 --> 01:12:53,485
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1394
01:12:53,487 --> 01:12:54,987
What are you getting away from?

1395
01:12:54,989 --> 01:12:58,557
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1396
01:12:58,559 --> 01:13:00,559
But you love him,
you two are this company.

1397
01:13:00,561 --> 01:13:01,927
Yin and yang.

1398
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:04,063
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1399
01:13:04,065 --> 01:13:08,601
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1400
01:13:08,603 --> 01:13:10,736
I never know what people want.

1401
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:12,573
What do you think they want?

1402
01:13:12,874 --> 01:13:13,939
Ease.

1403
01:13:13,941 --> 01:13:16,876
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1404
01:13:16,878 --> 01:13:20,478
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

1405
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,181
Yeah. Kind of like this case.

1406
01:13:22,183 --> 01:13:23,515
What? The Screenslaver?

1407
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:25,217
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

1408
01:13:25,219 --> 01:13:26,752
It was too easy.

1409
01:13:26,754 --> 01:13:29,523
That was too easy? Wow.

1410
01:13:30,124 --> 01:13:32,157
- Funny.
- What?

1411
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,759
Look at that.

1412
01:13:33,761 --> 01:13:37,897
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1413
01:13:37,899 --> 01:13:39,832
What?

1414
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:41,967
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1415
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:42,735
It is.

1416
01:13:42,737 --> 01:13:45,604
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

1417
01:13:45,606 --> 01:13:47,072
Maybe he hacked it?

1418
01:13:47,074 --> 01:13:49,775
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

1419
01:13:49,777 --> 01:13:52,544
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1420
01:13:52,546 --> 01:13:54,580
Maybe he wanted you to find him.

1421
01:13:54,582 --> 01:13:56,048
He wanted to get caught?

1422
01:13:56,050 --> 01:13:58,017
He wanted you to win.

1423
01:13:58,019 --> 01:14:00,519
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1424
01:14:00,521 --> 01:14:01,787
If he's smart enough to conceive

1425
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,255
of technology like this...

1426
01:14:03,257 --> 01:14:05,791
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1427
01:14:05,793 --> 01:14:07,927
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1428
01:14:07,929 --> 01:14:08,894
So?

1429
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:10,696
Einstein was a patent clerk.

1430
01:14:10,698 --> 01:14:12,831
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

1431
01:14:12,833 --> 01:14:15,200
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

1432
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:16,602
to hypnotize someone...

1433
01:14:16,604 --> 01:14:18,704
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1434
01:14:18,706 --> 01:14:22,877
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1435
01:14:25,079 --> 01:14:29,615
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1436
01:14:29,617 --> 01:14:30,916
but he was controlled
by the screens

1437
01:14:30,918 --> 01:14:32,086
built into his glasses...

1438
01:14:33,554 --> 01:14:35,589
You are good.

1439
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:40,693
<i>Look, the robot!</i>

1440
01:14:40,695 --> 01:14:42,094
<i>It's taking off.</i>

1441
01:14:42,096 --> 01:14:43,896
<i>I'm not getting a reading yet.</i>

1442
01:14:43,898 --> 01:14:44,830
<i>- Press "fire"?
- Now!</i>

1443
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,834
<i>More power.</i>

1444
01:14:48,836 --> 01:14:51,804
<i>Oh, I hope this works, Dad.</i>

1445
01:14:51,806 --> 01:14:54,707
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1446
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:57,643
Seventeen hours.

1447
01:14:57,645 --> 01:15:00,012
How do you feel?

1448
01:15:00,014 --> 01:15:01,113
Super.

1449
01:15:01,115 --> 01:15:04,083
<i>- You got it, Dad.
- Hurray!</i>

1450
01:15:04,085 --> 01:15:06,118
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

1451
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:08,187
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

1452
01:15:08,189 --> 01:15:11,623
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1453
01:15:11,625 --> 01:15:13,258
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

1454
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,860
My rates are far too high.

1455
01:15:14,862 --> 01:15:15,894
Oh, uh...

1456
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:18,330
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1457
01:15:18,332 --> 01:15:20,265
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1458
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:22,301
We deserve each other.

1459
01:15:22,303 --> 01:15:24,670
Your child is a polymorph.

1460
01:15:24,672 --> 01:15:27,006
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1461
01:15:27,008 --> 01:15:28,807
It is not unknown for supers

1462
01:15:28,809 --> 01:15:30,642
to have more than one
power when young...

1463
01:15:30,644 --> 01:15:33,278
but this little one has many.

1464
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,650
Yes, you have many powers.

1465
01:15:50,064 --> 01:15:52,297
I understand your lack of sleep

1466
01:15:52,299 --> 01:15:53,766
and coherency, Robert.

1467
01:15:53,768 --> 01:15:55,234
Babies can be anything,

1468
01:15:55,236 --> 01:15:56,902
and your child is no exception.

1469
01:15:56,904 --> 01:15:59,805
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1470
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:02,875
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1471
01:16:02,877 --> 01:16:05,277
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

1472
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,047
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms.

1473
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:10,749
What are you... You're
putting him in the...

1474
01:16:10,751 --> 01:16:11,984
In the chamber, Robert.

1475
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:13,786
He is part of the demonstration

1476
01:16:13,788 --> 01:16:14,920
and will be fine.

1477
01:16:14,922 --> 01:16:16,922
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1478
01:16:16,924 --> 01:16:18,690
who has multiple powers...

1479
01:16:18,692 --> 01:16:21,827
and no control over them, yes?

1480
01:16:21,829 --> 01:16:23,328
Huh. That sums it up.

1481
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:24,863
I often work to music

1482
01:16:24,865 --> 01:16:27,800
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1483
01:16:27,802 --> 01:16:29,802
Specifically, Mozart.

1484
01:16:29,804 --> 01:16:31,303
I blended Kevlar

1485
01:16:31,305 --> 01:16:33,672
with carbyne for
durability under duress...

1486
01:16:33,674 --> 01:16:35,340
and cotton for comfort.

1487
01:16:35,342 --> 01:16:38,911
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1488
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:41,980
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1489
01:16:41,982 --> 01:16:45,017
Oh, Lord! What is he doing?

1490
01:16:45,019 --> 01:16:48,087
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1491
01:16:48,089 --> 01:16:50,389
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

1492
01:16:50,391 --> 01:16:52,691
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1493
01:16:52,693 --> 01:16:53,792
Oh, no. Cookies.

1494
01:16:53,794 --> 01:16:55,294
I gotta get cookies!

1495
01:16:55,296 --> 01:16:57,262
You do not need cookies.

1496
01:16:57,264 --> 01:16:58,397
As I learned quite painfully

1497
01:16:58,399 --> 01:16:59,731
last night...

1498
01:16:59,733 --> 01:17:01,300
any solution involving cookies

1499
01:17:01,302 --> 01:17:04,369
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

1500
01:17:06,273 --> 01:17:07,806
"Combustion imminent"?

1501
01:17:07,808 --> 01:17:09,041
What does that mean?

1502
01:17:09,944 --> 01:17:11,710
It means fire, Robert,

1503
01:17:11,712 --> 01:17:13,946
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1504
01:17:13,948 --> 01:17:16,815
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1505
01:17:16,817 --> 01:17:18,919
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

1506
01:17:20,855 --> 01:17:22,688
The flame retardant

1507
01:17:22,690 --> 01:17:24,890
is blackberry lavender, darling.

1508
01:17:24,892 --> 01:17:27,793
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

1509
01:17:27,795 --> 01:17:31,063
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

1510
01:17:31,065 --> 01:17:33,966
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

1511
01:17:33,968 --> 01:17:35,968
for a single night's work...

1512
01:17:35,970 --> 01:17:37,269
the suit and device contain

1513
01:17:37,271 --> 01:17:39,471
a few more features
we need to discuss.

1514
01:17:39,473 --> 01:17:42,074
Thanks again, E, for everything.

1515
01:17:42,076 --> 01:17:43,809
How much do I owe you for...

1516
01:17:43,811 --> 01:17:46,778
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

1517
01:17:46,780 --> 01:17:48,881
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elastigirl,

1518
01:17:48,883 --> 01:17:51,283
and Frozone's
exclusive designer...

1519
01:17:51,285 --> 01:17:53,952
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1520
01:17:53,954 --> 01:17:55,988
But babysitting this one...

1521
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:59,026
I do for free, darling.

1522
01:18:16,443 --> 01:18:17,776
<i>I would resist</i>

1523
01:18:17,778 --> 01:18:19,077
<i>the temptation to stretch.</i>

1524
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:22,181
<i>The temperature around you
is well below freezing.</i>

1525
01:18:22,183 --> 01:18:24,950
<i>Try to stretch and you'll break.</i>

1526
01:18:24,952 --> 01:18:27,753
<i>So, you're the Screenslaver.</i>

1527
01:18:27,755 --> 01:18:30,088
<i>Yes and no.</i>

1528
01:18:30,090 --> 01:18:32,891
Let's say,
I created the character

1529
01:18:32,893 --> 01:18:34,793
and pre-recorded the messages.

1530
01:18:34,795 --> 01:18:36,161
<i>Does Winston know?</i>

1531
01:18:36,163 --> 01:18:39,097
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

1532
01:18:39,099 --> 01:18:41,534
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

1533
01:18:41,536 --> 01:18:43,335
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

1534
01:18:43,337 --> 01:18:45,003
<i>Worse than what you're doing?</i>

1535
01:18:45,005 --> 01:18:47,139
<i>Hey, I'm using the technology</i>

1536
01:18:47,141 --> 01:18:48,974
<i>to destroy people's trust in it.</i>

1537
01:18:48,976 --> 01:18:51,410
Like I'm using superheroes.

1538
01:18:51,412 --> 01:18:52,978
<i>Who did I put in jail?</i>

1539
01:18:52,980 --> 01:18:54,246
<i>Pizza delivery guy.</i>

1540
01:18:54,248 --> 01:18:56,048
<i>Seemed the right height, build.</i>

1541
01:18:56,050 --> 01:18:58,350
<i>He gave you a pretty good fight.</i>

1542
01:18:58,352 --> 01:18:59,952
<i>I should say I gave you</i>

1543
01:18:59,954 --> 01:19:01,320
<i>a pretty good fight through him.</i>

1544
01:19:01,322 --> 01:19:03,088
<i>But it doesn't bother you</i>

1545
01:19:03,090 --> 01:19:04,990
<i>that an innocent man is in jail?</i>

1546
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:08,227
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

1547
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:09,962
I counted on you.

1548
01:19:09,964 --> 01:19:11,396
That's why you failed.

1549
01:19:11,398 --> 01:19:12,965
What?

1550
01:19:12,967 --> 01:19:15,501
<i>Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?</i>

1551
01:19:15,503 --> 01:19:18,003
<i>Because my brother
knows the words</i>

1552
01:19:18,005 --> 01:19:19,104
<i>to your theme song?</i>

1553
01:19:19,106 --> 01:19:20,839
<i>We don't know each other.</i>

1554
01:19:20,841 --> 01:19:22,441
But you can count on me anyway.

1555
01:19:22,443 --> 01:19:24,209
<i>I am supposed to, aren't I?</i>

1556
01:19:24,211 --> 01:19:26,812
<i>Because you have
some strange abilities</i>

1557
01:19:26,814 --> 01:19:28,046
<i>and a shiny costume...</i>

1558
01:19:28,048 --> 01:19:30,483
<i>the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives</i>

1559
01:19:30,485 --> 01:19:32,518
<i>into your gloved hands.</i>

1560
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,053
<i>That's what my father believed.</i>

1561
01:19:35,055 --> 01:19:38,824
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1562
01:19:38,826 --> 01:19:41,126
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

1563
01:19:41,128 --> 01:19:45,531
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1564
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:50,335
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly...

1565
01:19:50,337 --> 01:19:53,005
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

1566
01:19:53,007 --> 01:19:54,406
<i>But why would you...</i>

1567
01:19:54,408 --> 01:19:56,076
- <i>Your brother...</i>
- Is a child!

1568
01:19:56,611 --> 01:19:58,277
<i>He remembers the time</i>

1569
01:19:58,279 --> 01:20:00,412
<i>when we had parents
and superheroes.</i>

1570
01:20:00,414 --> 01:20:04,349
<i>So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.</i>

1571
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:08,120
<i>Mommy and Daddy went away
because supers went away.</i>

1572
01:20:08,122 --> 01:20:10,889
<i>Our sweet parents were fools</i>

1573
01:20:10,891 --> 01:20:12,991
<i>to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.</i>

1574
01:20:12,993 --> 01:20:15,162
<i>Superheroes keep us weak.</i>

1575
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:17,499
Are you gonna kill me?

1576
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:19,333
Nah.

1577
01:20:21,368 --> 01:20:22,901
Using you is better.

1578
01:20:22,903 --> 01:20:25,904
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal...

1579
01:20:25,906 --> 01:20:27,374
forever.

1580
01:20:32,379 --> 01:20:34,048
Dada. Dada.

1581
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:37,117
Ready? Laser eyes.

1582
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,585
Stop.

1583
01:20:39,587 --> 01:20:41,019
- Wow!
- Yeah!

1584
01:20:41,021 --> 01:20:42,287
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, baby!

1585
01:20:42,289 --> 01:20:43,556
And that's not all. Watch this.

1586
01:20:43,558 --> 01:20:45,359
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1587
01:20:50,097 --> 01:20:52,197
- No way.
- That is crazy cool.

1588
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:53,499
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

1589
01:20:53,501 --> 01:20:54,900
- Let me try. I want him.
- Give him to me.

1590
01:20:54,902 --> 01:20:56,335
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1591
01:20:56,337 --> 01:20:58,337
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

1592
01:20:58,339 --> 01:21:01,006
This is potentially dangerous...

1593
01:21:01,008 --> 01:21:04,142
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1594
01:21:04,144 --> 01:21:06,013
Stop. See the screen.

1595
01:21:08,015 --> 01:21:10,315
He vanished! That's really cool!

1596
01:21:11,519 --> 01:21:13,085
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1597
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:14,986
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

1598
01:21:14,988 --> 01:21:16,955
Dimension four. See the shape?

1599
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:18,924
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

1600
01:21:18,926 --> 01:21:20,094
So, where is he?

1601
01:21:21,496 --> 01:21:24,062
He's... there!

1602
01:21:24,064 --> 01:21:26,100
Okay. Come out. Num-num cookie?

1603
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:29,301
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1604
01:21:29,303 --> 01:21:31,238
That's really cool.

1605
01:21:37,478 --> 01:21:39,945
- Hello?
- Elastigirl's in trouble.

1606
01:21:39,947 --> 01:21:41,246
What? What happened to her?

1607
01:21:41,248 --> 01:21:42,948
Sorry to tell you on the phone.

1608
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,383
Meet me on our ship at DEVTECH.

1609
01:21:44,385 --> 01:21:46,552
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1610
01:21:46,554 --> 01:21:48,987
What's at the ship at DEVTECH?

1611
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:50,523
Lucius? Bob. Helen's in trouble.

1612
01:21:50,525 --> 01:21:52,257
I need someone
to watch the kids.

1613
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:53,959
<i>Suit up. It might get weird.</i>

1614
01:21:53,961 --> 01:21:55,528
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1615
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:57,530
Where are you going ASAP?

1616
01:21:57,532 --> 01:21:59,164
You better be back ASAP!

1617
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:00,399
And leaving that suit.

1618
01:22:00,401 --> 01:22:02,200
I gotta go. I'll be home soon.

1619
01:22:02,202 --> 01:22:03,536
Lucius will be here sooner.

1620
01:22:03,538 --> 01:22:05,705
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

1621
01:22:05,707 --> 01:22:07,472
What's at the ship at DEVTECH?

1622
01:22:07,474 --> 01:22:10,010
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

1623
01:22:22,022 --> 01:22:23,422
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1624
01:22:23,424 --> 01:22:25,457
She may need it. You never know.

1625
01:22:25,459 --> 01:22:27,159
What's going on?

1626
01:22:27,161 --> 01:22:29,161
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

1627
01:22:29,163 --> 01:22:31,163
after getting a call
about Mom...

1628
01:22:31,165 --> 01:22:32,431
and then left.

1629
01:22:32,433 --> 01:22:34,199
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

1630
01:22:34,201 --> 01:22:37,436
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

1631
01:22:37,438 --> 01:22:38,540
Put that on.

1632
01:22:49,684 --> 01:22:52,417
Hello there, little fella.

1633
01:22:52,419 --> 01:22:54,052
Hello.

1634
01:22:54,054 --> 01:22:55,287
You kids aren't safe.

1635
01:22:55,289 --> 01:22:56,522
The Deavors sent us
to take you...

1636
01:22:56,524 --> 01:22:59,391
Well, isn't that redundant?

1637
01:22:59,393 --> 01:23:02,362
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

1638
01:23:04,666 --> 01:23:07,399
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1639
01:23:07,401 --> 01:23:09,367
I get it, managerial screw-up.

1640
01:23:09,369 --> 01:23:10,803
Tell Winston I handled it.

1641
01:23:10,805 --> 01:23:12,471
You understand, Ms...

1642
01:23:12,473 --> 01:23:13,739
Voyd.

1643
01:23:13,741 --> 01:23:15,342
Ms. Voyd.

1644
01:23:16,578 --> 01:23:17,545
Drive safely.

1645
01:23:27,354 --> 01:23:31,389
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

1646
01:23:31,391 --> 01:23:32,492
Hey.

1647
01:23:34,094 --> 01:23:35,497
That isn't gonna hold them long.

1648
01:23:36,598 --> 01:23:38,230
Dash, grab the baby!

1649
01:23:41,068 --> 01:23:42,236
Spread out!

1650
01:23:44,371 --> 01:23:45,403
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1651
01:23:45,405 --> 01:23:47,307
Dash!

1652
01:23:48,108 --> 01:23:49,511
We gotta get to my car.

1653
01:23:58,786 --> 01:24:00,853
What? What's going on?

1654
01:24:00,855 --> 01:24:02,256
Little fella!

1655
01:24:20,708 --> 01:24:22,374
It worked!

1656
01:24:28,115 --> 01:24:29,651
Incredibile, windows down!

1657
01:24:31,519 --> 01:24:32,520
Dive in!

1658
01:24:39,226 --> 01:24:41,694
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

1659
01:24:41,696 --> 01:24:43,228
Loudly, say your names.

1660
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:46,499
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1661
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,537
Lucius!

1662
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:53,575
Incredibile, escape!

1663
01:25:01,816 --> 01:25:03,315
Fill me in!

1664
01:25:03,317 --> 01:25:05,216
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

1665
01:25:05,218 --> 01:25:06,586
She seems physically fine

1666
01:25:06,588 --> 01:25:08,286
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver...

1667
01:25:08,288 --> 01:25:10,592
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

1668
01:25:14,328 --> 01:25:15,595
Strange how?

1669
01:25:23,871 --> 01:25:25,205
Helen?

1670
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,542
Helen, what are you...

1671
01:25:36,216 --> 01:25:37,750
Helen, it's me.

1672
01:25:54,434 --> 01:25:56,504
Incredibile, pull over.

1673
01:26:00,975 --> 01:26:03,909
We can't go to E's.

1674
01:26:03,911 --> 01:26:06,478
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

1675
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,446
They were wearing them, too.

1676
01:26:08,448 --> 01:26:11,282
They're all under
someone's control.

1677
01:26:11,284 --> 01:26:13,788
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

1678
01:26:15,288 --> 01:26:17,455
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1679
01:26:17,457 --> 01:26:19,257
No Mom, no Dad.

1680
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:20,458
No Lucius.

1681
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:24,297
But we have our powers,
this car...

1682
01:26:24,966 --> 01:26:28,534
and... what?

1683
01:26:40,581 --> 01:26:43,484
Incredibile, take us to DEVTECH.

1684
01:26:46,654 --> 01:26:49,021
<i>The kids have escaped
in a tricked-out car,</i>

1685
01:26:49,023 --> 01:26:50,556
<i>but we got Frozone.</i>

1686
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:53,561
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

1687
01:26:58,900 --> 01:27:01,000
Aw, we missed 'em!

1688
01:27:01,002 --> 01:27:05,606
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1689
01:27:08,308 --> 01:27:09,842
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1690
01:27:09,844 --> 01:27:12,812
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1691
01:27:20,454 --> 01:27:23,658
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

1692
01:27:31,331 --> 01:27:33,065
We didn't plan this well.

1693
01:27:33,067 --> 01:27:34,734
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

1694
01:27:34,736 --> 01:27:36,334
Yes, we're here.

1695
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:38,740
We need to be up there.

1696
01:27:39,707 --> 01:27:40,873
Hey...

1697
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:45,343
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

1698
01:27:45,345 --> 01:27:46,746
Wait, what? No.

1699
01:27:46,748 --> 01:27:48,481
- Yeah, baby!
- No, don't say any more...

1700
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:49,949
Max power! Launch!

1701
01:27:57,424 --> 01:27:59,390
Come on.

1702
01:28:01,929 --> 01:28:03,596
Hello! Glad you could come.

1703
01:28:03,598 --> 01:28:05,566
Welcome to the conference.

1704
01:28:15,910 --> 01:28:17,710
Our stars, where are they?

1705
01:28:17,712 --> 01:28:19,011
<i>The event's about to start.</i>

1706
01:28:19,013 --> 01:28:21,046
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1707
01:28:21,048 --> 01:28:23,549
<i>They'll join for the signing.</i>

1708
01:28:23,551 --> 01:28:26,051
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

1709
01:28:26,053 --> 01:28:30,689
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

1710
01:28:30,691 --> 01:28:31,824
So, hold onto something...

1711
01:28:31,826 --> 01:28:34,629
because we're going
to open her up!

1712
01:28:52,814 --> 01:28:55,481
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

1713
01:28:55,483 --> 01:28:56,682
I'm gonna search for them.

1714
01:28:56,684 --> 01:28:59,118
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

1715
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,153
Suck it up. I won't be long.

1716
01:29:01,155 --> 01:29:03,823
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1717
01:29:03,825 --> 01:29:06,625
This is important.
They are in trouble.

1718
01:29:06,627 --> 01:29:09,562
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

1719
01:29:09,564 --> 01:29:12,465
Keep him amused but quiet!

1720
01:29:13,668 --> 01:29:14,702
Ugh.

1721
01:29:24,512 --> 01:29:26,547
Shh! Quiet!

1722
01:29:27,447 --> 01:29:28,616
Huh?

1723
01:29:32,854 --> 01:29:33,855
Jack-Jack?

1724
01:29:43,698 --> 01:29:45,733
Jack-Jack? Jack-Jack!

1725
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:19,865
Jack-Jack!

1726
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:21,767
The mesmerized supers
know we're here...

1727
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:24,737
but I found Mom and Dad...
Where's Jack-Jack?

1728
01:30:24,739 --> 01:30:27,907
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1729
01:30:27,909 --> 01:30:29,677
The tracker. Use the tracker.

1730
01:30:33,581 --> 01:30:34,780
He's going up?

1731
01:30:34,782 --> 01:30:36,951
- He's in an elevator.
- Let's go!

1732
01:30:38,886 --> 01:30:41,553
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

1733
01:30:44,091 --> 01:30:46,058
And here they are, folks!

1734
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:48,961
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1735
01:30:48,963 --> 01:30:50,963
<i>I told you
they'd be there in time.</i>

1736
01:30:50,965 --> 01:30:53,666
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

1737
01:30:53,668 --> 01:30:55,634
Yeah. Night vision, et cetera...

1738
01:30:55,636 --> 01:30:57,002
They look good, right?

1739
01:30:57,004 --> 01:30:58,771
<i>So simple, even he can do it.</i>

1740
01:30:58,773 --> 01:31:02,775
And we're back live in
three, two, one...

1741
01:31:02,777 --> 01:31:04,543
This is a momentous occasion.

1742
01:31:04,545 --> 01:31:06,178
We've all managed to accomplish

1743
01:31:06,180 --> 01:31:09,682
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

1744
01:31:09,684 --> 01:31:11,550
We agree on something.

1745
01:31:14,622 --> 01:31:17,723
<i>We agree to undo a bad decision.</i>

1746
01:31:17,725 --> 01:31:19,024
<i>To make sure</i>

1747
01:31:19,026 --> 01:31:20,926
<i>a few extraordinarily
gifted members...</i>

1748
01:31:20,928 --> 01:31:23,729
<i>of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.</i>

1749
01:31:23,731 --> 01:31:27,099
<i>To invite them once again
to use their gifts...</i>

1750
01:31:27,101 --> 01:31:28,600
<i>to benefit the world.</i>

1751
01:31:28,602 --> 01:31:30,102
I thank all of you

1752
01:31:30,104 --> 01:31:32,972
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1753
01:31:32,974 --> 01:31:35,541
With special thanks
to Ambassador Selick.

1754
01:31:35,543 --> 01:31:37,242
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

1755
01:31:37,244 --> 01:31:38,711
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1756
01:31:38,713 --> 01:31:40,012
Thank you, Ambassador,

1757
01:31:40,014 --> 01:31:42,147
for your early
and very crucial support.

1758
01:31:42,149 --> 01:31:44,883
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you...

1759
01:31:44,885 --> 01:31:46,719
to be the first signature

1760
01:31:46,721 --> 01:31:49,857
on the International
Superhero Accord.

1761
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:52,994
There it is!

1762
01:32:06,707 --> 01:32:08,607
Holy cow!

1763
01:32:08,609 --> 01:32:10,978
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

1764
01:32:17,618 --> 01:32:19,620
They're coming.

1765
01:32:28,829 --> 01:32:30,295
Is it okay to give him that?

1766
01:32:30,297 --> 01:32:33,265
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

1767
01:32:57,324 --> 01:32:59,058
No!

1768
01:32:59,060 --> 01:33:00,793
Come on, Jack-Jack.

1769
01:33:00,795 --> 01:33:02,061
We have to go.

1770
01:33:02,063 --> 01:33:03,197
Cookie num-num?

1771
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:18,644
- Mama, Mama.
- I see him. He's getting away!

1772
01:33:18,646 --> 01:33:19,947
Stand back.

1773
01:33:23,851 --> 01:33:26,020
- Darn it!
- He's heading for Mom.

1774
01:33:28,389 --> 01:33:31,824
It is done.
The world is super again.

1775
01:33:37,098 --> 01:33:39,765
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1776
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:42,701
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

1777
01:33:42,703 --> 01:33:44,171
Everyone, smile.

1778
01:33:50,845 --> 01:33:52,811
Go on phase two.

1779
01:33:52,813 --> 01:33:55,214
<i>Years of mandated
hiding and silence</i>

1780
01:33:55,216 --> 01:33:56,849
have made us bitter.

1781
01:33:56,851 --> 01:33:58,717
You bring us out
into the light...

1782
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:00,018
<i>only to clean up the messes</i>

1783
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:02,087
<i>your lack of discipline creates.</i>

1784
01:34:02,089 --> 01:34:04,723
<i>Your bodies
and your character are weak.</i>

1785
01:34:04,725 --> 01:34:08,393
<i>Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.</i>

1786
01:34:08,395 --> 01:34:10,262
<i>We no longer serve you.</i>

1787
01:34:10,264 --> 01:34:11,864
<i>We serve only us.</i>

1788
01:34:11,866 --> 01:34:13,901
<i>May the fittest survive.</i>

1789
01:34:16,270 --> 01:34:17,302
<i>Well, we, um...</i>

1790
01:34:17,304 --> 01:34:20,072
<i>Some very alarming
moments there...</i>

1791
01:34:20,074 --> 01:34:22,875
<i>before the, uh,
technical difficulties.</i>

1792
01:34:22,877 --> 01:34:24,278
<i>Please bear with us.</i>

1793
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:38,957
What?

1794
01:34:38,959 --> 01:34:40,459
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1795
01:34:40,461 --> 01:34:42,027
Hold! Let him talk.

1796
01:34:42,029 --> 01:34:44,029
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat.

1797
01:34:44,031 --> 01:34:44,897
Now.

1798
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:57,809
A little further.

1799
01:34:57,811 --> 01:34:59,847
<i>Little further. Stop.</i>

1800
01:35:05,419 --> 01:35:07,986
What the... A baby?

1801
01:35:07,988 --> 01:35:10,024
Mom and Dad. Uncle Lucius?

1802
01:35:12,459 --> 01:35:14,193
- My mama.
- Jack-Jack, no!

1803
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:19,066
A super baby?

1804
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,337
No, no, no!

1805
01:35:25,339 --> 01:35:26,340
<i>Put him down!</i>

1806
01:35:28,142 --> 01:35:29,808
- Grab her!
- No!

1807
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:30,978
Hold Jack-Jack.

1808
01:35:39,186 --> 01:35:41,119
No!

1809
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:42,988
Hey, it's me!

1810
01:35:42,990 --> 01:35:44,389
Yeah, that's what
I thought last time.

1811
01:35:44,391 --> 01:35:47,294
Kids, what are you...

1812
01:35:48,896 --> 01:35:51,497
You came for us?

1813
01:35:51,499 --> 01:35:52,864
Don't be mad.

1814
01:35:52,866 --> 01:35:55,336
Oh, sweetie, how could I be mad?

1815
01:35:56,237 --> 01:35:58,538
I'm proud.

1816
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:00,405
Not to break up a tender moment,

1817
01:36:00,407 --> 01:36:01,907
but where are we?

1818
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:03,375
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1819
01:36:03,377 --> 01:36:05,377
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver...

1820
01:36:05,379 --> 01:36:08,180
and until a second ago, us.

1821
01:36:08,182 --> 01:36:10,249
Where's the crew?

1822
01:36:10,251 --> 01:36:12,451
<i>Collision detected.
Correct course.</i>

1823
01:36:12,453 --> 01:36:13,852
Uh-oh. Did I do that?

1824
01:36:13,854 --> 01:36:17,057
Mom, the suit? Try this.

1825
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:21,929
Phase Three. Go on Phase Three!

1826
01:36:25,099 --> 01:36:27,466
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1827
01:36:27,468 --> 01:36:28,867
I went to the house.

1828
01:36:28,869 --> 01:36:30,235
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

1829
01:36:30,237 --> 01:36:32,437
Hey! We just saved you!

1830
01:36:32,439 --> 01:36:34,507
Escape? Escape from who?

1831
01:36:37,411 --> 01:36:38,445
Those guys!

1832
01:36:41,148 --> 01:36:43,882
What the...?
Jack-Jack has powers?

1833
01:36:43,884 --> 01:36:46,018
We know. Fight now, talk later.

1834
01:37:19,186 --> 01:37:20,919
Jack-Jack.

1835
01:37:20,921 --> 01:37:22,254
Laser eyes!

1836
01:37:32,032 --> 01:37:33,231
Ah-ha!

1837
01:37:43,944 --> 01:37:45,145
Ugh.

1838
01:37:50,084 --> 01:37:52,117
Come with me, Winston.

1839
01:37:52,119 --> 01:37:54,086
- Did I faint?
- You'll be safe here.

1840
01:37:54,088 --> 01:37:56,090
Safe? Safe from what?

1841
01:37:57,191 --> 01:37:59,458
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

1842
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,593
Still hypnotized.

1843
01:38:00,595 --> 01:38:03,097
What have you done?

1844
01:38:07,234 --> 01:38:09,434
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1845
01:38:09,436 --> 01:38:10,469
Well, go after her.

1846
01:38:10,471 --> 01:38:11,269
Finish your mission.

1847
01:38:11,271 --> 01:38:13,972
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

1848
01:38:13,974 --> 01:38:16,576
- Jack-Jack, who's gonna...
- Mom!

1849
01:38:16,578 --> 01:38:18,445
Go. We've got this.

1850
01:38:20,214 --> 01:38:22,114
Voyd, come with me.

1851
01:38:22,116 --> 01:38:23,516
I'll go shut down the engine.

1852
01:38:23,518 --> 01:38:25,183
I'll try to slow the
ship from the bow.

1853
01:38:25,185 --> 01:38:28,120
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1854
01:38:28,122 --> 01:38:29,990
Strap in now!

1855
01:38:45,339 --> 01:38:47,007
It's for your own good.

1856
01:38:47,307 --> 01:38:49,007
No!

1857
01:38:49,009 --> 01:38:50,342
This is.

1858
01:39:01,422 --> 01:39:04,057
- We're too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1859
01:39:28,015 --> 01:39:30,750
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

1860
01:39:30,752 --> 01:39:33,084
You want me to un-crush?

1861
01:39:33,086 --> 01:39:34,720
What? No one's ever
asked for that?

1862
01:39:34,722 --> 01:39:37,723
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

1863
01:39:37,725 --> 01:39:39,324
To get into the engine room.

1864
01:39:39,326 --> 01:39:40,560
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

1865
01:39:40,562 --> 01:39:43,128
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

1866
01:39:43,130 --> 01:39:44,298
What do you do?

1867
01:39:48,035 --> 01:39:49,569
Welcome aboard, Elastigirl.

1868
01:39:49,571 --> 01:39:51,269
<i>Although we haven't yet reached</i>

1869
01:39:51,271 --> 01:39:52,607
<i>our cruising altitude...</i>

1870
01:39:54,141 --> 01:39:56,509
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

1871
01:39:56,511 --> 01:39:59,177
Or just relax...

1872
01:39:59,179 --> 01:40:02,149
<i>and let the cabin roam
about you.</i>

1873
01:40:11,091 --> 01:40:13,091
I can't get to the engine room!

1874
01:40:13,093 --> 01:40:14,494
We gotta do something!

1875
01:40:14,496 --> 01:40:16,161
Because trying to
slow it down ain't working.

1876
01:40:16,163 --> 01:40:18,096
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

1877
01:40:18,098 --> 01:40:19,297
The steering's been destroyed!

1878
01:40:19,299 --> 01:40:22,100
- Dash means from the outside!
- Yeah!

1879
01:40:22,102 --> 01:40:23,201
If we break off one of the foils

1880
01:40:23,203 --> 01:40:24,369
and turn the rudder...

1881
01:40:24,371 --> 01:40:26,739
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

1882
01:40:26,741 --> 01:40:28,206
That might work.

1883
01:40:28,208 --> 01:40:29,341
I'll turn the front,
you turn the rear.

1884
01:40:29,343 --> 01:40:31,443
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

1885
01:40:31,445 --> 01:40:32,712
How am I supposed to get...

1886
01:40:32,714 --> 01:40:34,614
All right. Come on, kids.

1887
01:40:34,616 --> 01:40:37,650
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

1888
01:40:37,652 --> 01:40:40,185
But if it doesn't,
and we crash...

1889
01:40:40,187 --> 01:40:43,589
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1890
01:40:43,591 --> 01:40:47,261
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

1891
01:40:47,795 --> 01:40:49,294
That's my girl.

1892
01:40:49,296 --> 01:40:51,733
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

1893
01:40:58,405 --> 01:41:00,407
You know what's sad?

1894
01:41:03,678 --> 01:41:05,578
If it weren't
for your core beliefs...

1895
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:08,315
I think we could have
been good friends.

1896
01:41:09,316 --> 01:41:11,285
At least...

1897
01:41:12,219 --> 01:41:14,254
I have core beliefs.

1898
01:41:15,690 --> 01:41:17,155
<i>We have breaking news...</i>

1899
01:41:17,157 --> 01:41:19,291
<i>While there is
still no radio contact,</i>

1900
01:41:19,293 --> 01:41:20,826
<i>the ship
has changed direction...</i>

1901
01:41:20,828 --> 01:41:22,127
<i>and is heading towards land</i>

1902
01:41:22,129 --> 01:41:23,498
<i>at a high rate of speed.</i>

1903
01:41:27,769 --> 01:41:29,303
So, Dash...

1904
01:41:30,437 --> 01:41:31,904
I am going to the rudder.

1905
01:41:31,906 --> 01:41:35,206
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1906
01:41:35,208 --> 01:41:37,175
- Okay, Dad.
- Now lower me down...

1907
01:41:41,315 --> 01:41:44,617
The reputations of
superheroes are ruined.

1908
01:41:44,619 --> 01:41:48,188
You will never
become legal. Ever.

1909
01:41:48,556 --> 01:41:49,789
Never?

1910
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,356
No.

1911
01:41:51,358 --> 01:41:53,425
- Ever?
- No.

1912
01:41:53,427 --> 01:41:56,729
Not even a little
smidgee-widgee?

1913
01:41:56,731 --> 01:41:58,196
Oh, hypoxia.

1914
01:41:58,198 --> 01:41:59,832
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

1915
01:41:59,834 --> 01:42:02,202
things seem really silly.

1916
01:42:08,442 --> 01:42:10,509
Things get sillier

1917
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:12,612
and sillier and then you die.

1918
01:42:12,614 --> 01:42:14,580
I don't wanna die.

1919
01:42:14,582 --> 01:42:16,517
Ah, nobody does.

1920
01:42:17,284 --> 01:42:18,517
Really.

1921
01:42:18,519 --> 01:42:20,755
Not such a bad way to go.

1922
01:42:39,574 --> 01:42:41,674
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1923
01:42:41,676 --> 01:42:44,411
All supers,
protect your ambassadors!

1924
01:42:45,245 --> 01:42:46,614
Follow.

1925
01:42:49,584 --> 01:42:51,784
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

1926
01:42:59,827 --> 01:43:01,459
We gotta pull him up.

1927
01:43:01,461 --> 01:43:02,864
Wait. It's too soon.

1928
01:43:16,944 --> 01:43:18,577
I'm gonna press the button!

1929
01:43:18,579 --> 01:43:19,580
Not yet!

1930
01:43:34,461 --> 01:43:36,430
It's turning. It's working.

1931
01:43:40,001 --> 01:43:42,335
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1932
01:43:45,305 --> 01:43:46,708
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1933
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:51,043
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1934
01:43:51,045 --> 01:43:52,578
Make a chute!

1935
01:43:54,782 --> 01:43:56,818
Helen! Brace yourselves!

1936
01:44:04,959 --> 01:44:06,694
Crash positions!

1937
01:44:25,312 --> 01:44:26,545
Whoo.

1938
01:44:26,547 --> 01:44:29,851
I missed
Jack-Jack's first power?

1939
01:44:30,752 --> 01:44:33,384
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

1940
01:44:33,386 --> 01:44:34,987
Oh!

1941
01:44:46,734 --> 01:44:51,402
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1942
01:44:51,404 --> 01:44:53,371
But it does make you alive.

1943
01:44:53,373 --> 01:44:55,340
And I'm grateful for that.

1944
01:44:55,342 --> 01:44:58,376
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

1945
01:44:58,378 --> 01:45:00,012
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

1946
01:45:00,014 --> 01:45:02,380
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

1947
01:45:02,382 --> 01:45:04,984
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

1948
01:45:04,986 --> 01:45:07,853
And who knows what the
future may bring...

1949
01:45:07,855 --> 01:45:11,624
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1950
01:45:11,626 --> 01:45:13,092
Hmm. Good feeling.

1951
01:45:13,094 --> 01:45:14,860
Should we be worried?

1952
01:45:14,862 --> 01:45:17,630
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

1953
01:45:17,632 --> 01:45:19,598
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1954
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:20,833
No pun intended.

1955
01:45:20,835 --> 01:45:22,568
Sorry I had to punch you.

1956
01:45:24,138 --> 01:45:27,675
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1957
01:45:39,821 --> 01:45:43,454
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

1958
01:45:43,456 --> 01:45:44,657
they have demonstrated...

1959
01:45:44,659 --> 01:45:47,126
the legal status of superheroes

1960
01:45:47,128 --> 01:45:49,460
is hereby restored.

1961
01:45:58,438 --> 01:46:00,438
You don't know me, do you?

1962
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:01,807
No, I don't...

1963
01:46:01,809 --> 01:46:02,975
Wait.

1964
01:46:02,977 --> 01:46:05,077
Are you the girl with the water?

1965
01:46:05,079 --> 01:46:07,580
I'm Violet Parr.

1966
01:46:07,582 --> 01:46:09,114
- I'm Tony.
- Okay.

1967
01:46:09,116 --> 01:46:11,819
You split up into separate
groups and stuff...

1968
01:46:20,061 --> 01:46:21,459
Tony, this is my mom.

1969
01:46:21,461 --> 01:46:22,661
Pleased to meet you.

1970
01:46:22,663 --> 01:46:24,697
- This is my dad.
- Oh, we've met.

1971
01:46:24,699 --> 01:46:26,765
And this is embarrassing.

1972
01:46:26,767 --> 01:46:28,033
Charmed, I'm sure.

1973
01:46:28,035 --> 01:46:30,202
My little brother, Dash.

1974
01:46:30,204 --> 01:46:32,437
And the baby is Jack-Jack.

1975
01:46:32,439 --> 01:46:35,473
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

1976
01:46:35,475 --> 01:46:38,143
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

1977
01:46:38,145 --> 01:46:40,613
We'll be sitting
on the other side of the theater.

1978
01:46:40,615 --> 01:46:42,147
Not watching you.

1979
01:46:42,149 --> 01:46:44,083
He's kidding.

1980
01:46:44,085 --> 01:46:47,186
They are only dropping
us off at the theater.

1981
01:46:47,188 --> 01:46:49,922
They have other things to do.

1982
01:46:49,924 --> 01:46:52,658
So, you guys are close, I guess.

1983
01:46:52,660 --> 01:46:55,027
- Yeah, I guess.
- We can get closer.

1984
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:56,528
Bob.

1985
01:47:11,045 --> 01:47:12,211
Stop! Let us out!

1986
01:47:12,213 --> 01:47:13,879
Here, large popcorn, small soda.

1987
01:47:13,881 --> 01:47:16,615
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1988
01:47:16,617 --> 01:47:19,720
I'll be back before
the previews are over.
